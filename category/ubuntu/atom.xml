    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ever since I've switched to Mac OS X I liked its shortcut modifiers more than the ones available on Windows / Linux. While I do agree that sometimes
you lose count of the number of modifier keys that you have to press in order to get something done, most of the cases that claim is just FUD.</p>

<p>The ergonomy of the Mac has also made its way into how shortcuts are defined. The <code>Command</code> key, positioned where <code>Alt</code> is on PC keyboards, is
definitely better positioned when it comes to using that key as your main modifier for shortcuts. Call it the power of habit, but every time I
switch to a PC I find myself pressing the <code>Alt</code> key instead of <code>Control</code>. And that's because <code>Alt</code> is in a handier position.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I bought a <a href="http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/index.php/products/code-keyboard/code-87-key-mechanical-keyboard.html" title="CODE 87-Key Mechanical Keyboard ">CODE ten-keyless mechanical keyboard</a>.
One of the nifty features (and there are plenty) is the ability to change the layout of your keyboard with a combination of DIP switches located on
the back. Obviously, it can be configured to a Mac layout. But what do you do when you want to use the same keyboard on your Linux box, from time to
time? I mean you're mostly using <code>Command</code> for your shortcuts. Remapping the shortcuts in your head to <code>Control</code> is not that easy at first.</p>

<h2>XKB</h2>

<p>Luckily Ubuntu, like many other Linux distros, comes with <code>xkb</code> - the X KeyBoard extension. This extension is responsible for mapping the physical
keys of your keyboard to their designed function. <code>xkb</code> symbol files can be found in <code>/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols</code> and it's good to know that they're
localised, in case you need to add some language-specific mappings. However, in my case, I need to remap some of the modifier keys.</p>

<p>The modifier keys are mapped in <code>/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/pc</code>, a file which is inherited by all other configurations. Since I just want to replace
<code>Super</code> with <code>Control</code>, the changes are minimal:</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<pre><code>key &lt;LCTL&gt; {    [ Super_L       ]   };
key &lt;LWIN&gt; {    [ Control_L     ]   };
key &lt;RCTL&gt; {    [ Super_R       ]   };
key &lt;RWIN&gt; {    [ Control_R     ]   };
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>In order to apply the new mappings you need to clear out <code>xkb</code>'s cache from <code>/var/lib/xkb</code>:</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<pre><code>rm -rf /var/lib/xkb/*
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Afterwards just restart your X session and you're good to go. Even though this small change doesn't make all shortcuts to work like on a Mac it's still
a lot better than without it.</p>
