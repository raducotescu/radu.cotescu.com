  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you had time to read my blog before you would notice that I mostly write about technical stuff. Since Google indexes my pages, most of the users that arrive here are more or less above average when it comes to computers. Using the Analytics tool provided by Google, I get the following data when it comes to OS usage:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Windows - 56.53 %</p></li>
<li><p>Linux - 38.30 %</p></li>
<li><p>Macintosh - 4.67 %</p></li>
<li><p>Others - 0.5 % (iPod, iPhone, Android, BlackBerry, SymbianOS, NetBSD)</p></li>
</ol>


<p>My curiosity, given the fact that I write most about Linux (especially Ubuntu) here, is what, considering the percent of Windows users reaching here, keeps them from not making the switch. Therefore, I will resort using a poll for finding out the answer.</p>

<p>[poll id=&#8221;3&#8221; type=&#8221;result&#8221;]</p>

<p>If you have other reasons for which you haven&#8217;t switched please write them in the comments. I really want to know what&#8217;s keeping you using Windows and what could be done for Linux to gain more users. Thank you!</p>

      <p class="meta">
        








  


<time datetime="2009-10-11T14:12:04+03:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Oct 11<span>th</span>, 2009</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ubuntu 9.10, codenamed Karmic Koala, is just about the corner, with its programmed launch on October 29th. This release is a special one, preparing the way for the next LTS which is due to appear the next April (Lucid Lynx, 10.04). Lots and lots of features and improvements have been added, the main goal being to achieve a 10 second boot time for Lucid. In order to obtain that spectacular time, Karmic changed a few key components of the OS comparing it with the current release, 9.04 (codenamed Jaunty Jackalope).</p>

<h3><code>upstart</code></h3>

<p><code>upstart</code> is an event-based replacement for the usual <code>/sbin/init</code> daemon which handles starting of tasks and services during boot, stopping them during shutdown and supervising them while the system is running. Developed initially for the Ubuntu distribution, upstart is intended to be suitable for deployment in all Linux distributions as a replacement for System-V init. Among upstart&#8217;s users there are Fedora 9 and later, Debian (optional), Nokia&#8217;s Maemo platform and Palm&#8217;s WebOS.</p>

<h3><code>xsplash</code></h3>

<p>Having X starting sooner helped improve the boot times for Ubuntu. <code>xsplash</code> replaces <code>usplash</code> for displaying the boot screen, which allows using native resolutions, eliminating disproportioned boot screens. The only downside is that at shutdown, when the X is stopped, so is <code>xsplash</code>, removing all the eye-candy that masks the shutdown information. Therefore the user sees all the information regarding shutting down processes.</p>

<h3>Ubuntu Software Center</h3>

<p><em>Ubuntu Software Center</em> is a new application meant to replace <em>Synaptic Package Manager</em>, <em>Add/Remove&#8230;</em>, <em>Software Sources</em>, <em>Gdebi </em>and possible <em>Update Manager</em>. Again this is targeted at the 10.04 release, but the application has made it in Karmic. With a clean and interesting UI, the software center wants to be an easy and intuitive way to install applications and possible (in the future) to buy them. For every application there is the possibility of displaying a screen-shot that should preview the user where he/she should look for the launcher after the application is installed or how the application looks like.</p>

<h3>Ubuntu One</h3>

<p>Karmic Koala includes by default the client for accessing <a href="https://one.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu One</a> on-line file sharing and storing sevice which is based on Amazon S3 storage servers. The service is similar to <a href="http://getdropbox.com">Dropbox</a>, but unfortunately inferior in features and portability, as it runs only on Ubuntu clients (from 9.04 and forward). The service offers free 2GB accounts and 50GB payed ones ($10.00 USD).</p>

<h3>Other features</h3>

<p>Ubuntu 9.10 will include the new GNOME 2.28, <em>ext4</em> file system by default (the other file systems are still available using the manual partitioner, but will no longer be upgraded) and GRUB 2. Other security improvements have been added like <em>AppArmor</em> application profiles, better capabilities for UFW (<em>Uncomplicated Firewall</em>) and memory execution protection by handling code different.</p>

<h3>User experience</h3>

<p>I have tested Karmic Koala in a virtual machine using Sun&#8217;s VirtualBox allocating 512MB RAM and 2 processors, with a 3 partition style (swap, root folder and home folder - both <em>ext4</em>) for an 8GB virtual disk. The system boots incredibly fast (less than 20 seconds) and has a nice look. GNOME 2.28 has changed a bit from 2.26.1 whichÂ  is shipped in Ubuntu 9.04. I have also tested Empathy, the new multi-protocol instant messaging client, but I wasn&#8217;t thrilled. It still needs some features that Pidgin has been offering in the last two years. Still the desktop sharing functions and the audio/video capabilities (via selected protocols) are a strong addition. If you want to obtain the full performance potential <em>ext4</em> has to offer, you should opt for a clean install though. Just upgrading <em>ext3</em> to <em>ext4</em> won&#8217;t suffice, even if you will obtain some improvements. So be careful to use backups at least for your home folder.</p>

<p>Can&#8217;t wait for the official release! Will you upgrade too?</p>

<p>From the middle of July I have started a nice collaboration with OXY PRESS, the company responsible for the Linux Identity magazine series. They have asked me to write some articles for the Linux Starter Kit magazine, regarding Ubuntu 9.04 which I gladly did. I was happy to be able to share my experience with Ubuntu and do this for a magazine, not only for my blog. The result is finally ready and is available for buying from a various distribution market starting with October 9th.</p>

<p>Linux Starter Kit is aimed for those people new to Linux (n00bs as I like to call them, and this is not in a bad sense) and is trying to help them make their transition to this wonderful OS, usually from a proprietary world, as smooth as possible, showing them all the benefits one can gain by using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software">free</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">open-source</a> software. Treating aspects like installing Linux, configuring a dual boot, installing counterpart software for the one available for Windows and many more topics that are extremely important for the new user, this 5th issue about Ubuntu 9.04 is a really nice one, not only because I contributed to it but because Ubuntu has reached a level of user friendliness and popularity that boosts this distribution among the best out there.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Starting with August 21st I have installed Windows 7 on my home desktop, right after installing Ubuntu 9.04 with custom packages so that I could obtain the maximum hard disk performance gain for Linux. Being a student at an Automatic Control and Computers Faculty has its advantages, one of them being the MSDN AA membership which offers free licenses to students and personnel.</p>

<p>Talking with friends and acquaintances (fellow geeks and IT professionals) we almost unanimously declared that Windows 7 seems to be, comparing it to Windows Vista, what XP proved to be for Windows Millennium: salvation. I have used Vista too for almost 6 months on the same hardware I now run 7 and the gap between them is amazing. Given the fact that support for Windows XP is offered until 2014, I donât see why Microsoft risked so much of its public image by launching an operating system with serious usability flaws, not to mention the huge amount of resources wasted for anything but performance, instead of directly launching 7.</p>

<p>MSDN AA offers students licenses for Windows 7 Professional, on both current architectures: x86 (32-bit) and x64 (64-bit). Since I do not have 4 GB of RAM on any of the computers I own, I chose to use the 32-bit version. This was also imposed by the system requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>1 gigahertz (GHz) or faster 32-bit (x86) or 64-bit (x64)</p></li>
<li><p>1 gigabyte (GB) RAM (32-bit) or 2 GB RAM (64-bit) (my desktop has only 1 GB of RAM, my laptop has 2 GB)</p></li>
<li><p>16 GB available hard disk space (32-bit) or 20 GB (64-bit)</p></li>
<li><p>DirectX 9 graphics device with WDDM 1.0 or higher driver</p></li>
</ul>


<p>To provide some real facts about my systems, these are their specifications:</p>

<h2>The install process</h2>

<p>Installation went pretty smooth, with 15 minutes to complete on my laptop and almost 20 minutes for the desktop. Just choose the partition on which you want to install the system, your language and location and wait for the process to finish. Provide your username when finished and, for obvious security reasons, provide a password since the first account created is an Administrator account. The single stupid field here is the one where you <em>must</em> provide a password hint in case you accidentally forget the password. Use a space if you donât want to provide a real hint.</p>

<p>Keep in mind though that it took 20 minutes to install an operating system without any additional software like email client, office productivity suite, graphics editing, etc. Not the same comparing to Ubuntu.</p>

<h2>Drivers</h2>

<p>The model adopted by Microsoft now is pretty close to what Linux does for years: either integrate the drivers in the OS, either provide easy ways to automatically download and install them to your system. Itâs surely a premiere for Windows, but there are still a few things that could be improved. While in Ubuntu I get the latest Nvidia drivers for my cards, Windows just provides a generic approved driver by Microsoft that doesnât enable the use of full potential graphic power processing. Therefore you still need to download and install the drivers from Nvidiaâs site in order to enjoy the best performance.</p>

<p>The things donât go the same when the OS must recognize a laptopâs special keys (the ones that offer you alternative functions when you press the Fn button too). For my laptop I had to download the driver for Vista from the manufacturerâs site, although in Ubuntu everything works by default (some of these buttons became a standard on all laptops).</p>

<h2>Vista comparison</h2>

<p>Comparing Windows 7 with Vista is a natural thing to do. After all, 7 is here to try to fix what Vista has done to Microsoftâs sales numbers and image. And I personally think that its purpose is accomplished. UAC (User Account Control) doesnât bug you anymore for every little operation you want to do, copying files doesnât take an eternity now (and 7 doesnât need a service pack to correct this issue), finding drivers is easier and the overall speed of the operating system is considerably improved.</p>

<p>Running software made for XP though is supported better in a strange way because Microsoft offers a free downloadable Windows XP virtual machine that runs inside 7 (you need at least 2GB of RAM and an extra 15GB HDD space for Windows XP Mode and this can only be achieved on Windows 7 Enterprise, Windows 7 Professional, and Windows 7 Ultimate). Add that to the system requirements for 7 alone and you will need almost 31GB of HDD space just for running the new Windows with improved compatibility for older versions of Windows.</p>

<h2>New features</h2>

<p>To create the impression of new, Microsoft added some enhancements to 7:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>a new taskbar with functionalities similar to Macâs dock, but still looking like a taskbar;</p></li>
<li><p>jump lists for Microsoft programs which basically adds common used program menu entries to its taskbar iconâs context menu;</p></li>
<li><p>auto expanding a window (snap) when you drag it close to the top screen margin;</p></li>
<li><p>the crappy Internet Explorer 8;</p></li>
<li><p>they say better device management (a window that should show you relevant information about devices and printers connected to your PC), I say a function that will work only after hardware manufacturers implement Device Stage (which has nothing to do with standards);</p></li>
<li><p>HomeGroup - a feature that should carelessly enable sharing printers and files between computers that run 7 (it needs IPv6 enabled). This one represents actually the sole <strong>new</strong> feature. The others are just visual effects or windows showing more details than before.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Broken interoperability</h2>

<p>Before Windows Vista, you could have seen Windows shares on the network from GNOMEâs Nautilus file browser from Linux. The only thing one had to do was to go to Network, select Windows Network and then just browse the computer available and the shares. From Vista and forward, Microsoft changed the way their OS handles file sharing with non-Windows OS, resulting in a lack of functionality by not allowing Linux users to easily browse shared filed and folders from Windows. To be able to see Windowsâ shared folders you have to manually mount the shares using a command like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>sudo mount -t cifs -o <span class="nv">username</span><span class="o">=</span>windowsUserNmae,password<span class="o">=</span>windowsPassword //win7share mountFolder
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Another option (which I donât recommend in case one of the computers is a laptop) is adding and entry in your <code>fstab</code> file describing your Samba share. The reason for which I do not recommend this is that when the share is unavailable, your Linux system log will be filled with errors related to the failed mount operation, not to say about the processing time lost just because of this.</p>

<p>Probably this issue will be addressed soon by the Linux community. After all Ubuntu 9.10 will be launched the same month like Windows 7. Therefore if you are lazy enough to not want to write that line every time you want to mount a Windows share, you could build a script for that sending the <code>shareName</code> and <code>theFolderWhereYouWantTheMount</code> as parameters.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>Is Windows 7 better than Windows Vista? Positively sure. And I can say that itâs better than XP too. After all Windows Vista tried to introduce some new technologies comparing it to XP. It failed, I give you that, but the step has been made. 7 corrects these issues and represents the OSÂ  that Microsoft probably wanted in the first place. Most users say that Vista(and consequently 7) is bad just because it eats more resources than XP. But remember that XP needed more resources than Windows 2000 and that it wasnât quite the OS that became after SP2 from launch time. I think the most important thing that Vista failed to offer was compatibility. 7 fixes that. Having decent system requirements (1GB of RAM is extremely cheap these days), 7 feels fast and responsive and has great boot times. After all, donât expect that your 1.6 GHz P4 with 256MB of RAM bought in 2002 should last for years and run all the new software that appears nowadays. Even video games increase their system requirements from the previous version to the current one. Yes, Linux runs on lower resources and itâs faster, but it might not appeal all the users out there unfortunately (look at the market share), although distributions like Ubuntu, openSUSE and Fedora try to compensate for this becoming more and more user friendly.</p>

<p>For the non tech savvy user Windows 7 is a delightful operating system. He/she wonât feel the limitations imposed by Microsoft and other proprietary software vendors. It costs more than Linux (I am talking about Linux distributions that for a fee offer you support and updates) but being more common it offers you a great stack of acclaimed software (free or not). You still need to install an anti-virus to keep your system clean, although one could use Windows Defender (I personally donât trust it).</p>

<p>Given the fact that I use Linux constantly on my machines, Windows 7 doesnât have any chance in making me change my mind. And I guess the same applies for each experienced user. Windows seems okay for browsing the web, reading emails, writing documents and creating spreadsheets but when I really want power and control, Linux is the winner. When it comes to GUI (Graphical User Interface) Linux can do things that a Windows user can only dream on. Not only that I am the one who controls what my computer does, I am free to change every little aspect of how my computer works. And I canât do that in Windows, despite how hard I try.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://motane.lu">Tudor</a> has found a <a href="http://blog.motane.lu/2009/08/21/advertising-blog-entries-on-pidgins-status/">better solution</a> to advertise one&#8217;s blog posts with the help of Pidgin and a little bit of Python. I did argue with him a bit regarding the number of requests made (you can see that in the comments on his blog post) but finally I would agree that his solution was better than mine, only that I felt the need to improve it a bit. This still needs to set DBUS session parameters at log in time, and thanks to <a href="http://earlruby.org">Earl Ruby</a> this can be done easily too.</p>

<p>The script is pretty simple and I made it write a log to <code>stdout</code>, which with the help of <code>cron</code> can be piped to any file you want. Knock yourself out:</p>

<p>Setting your DBUS session parameters requires exporting some variables to your environment. Take the script below and add it via <em>System - Preferences - Startup Applications</em> to the list of programs that start at log in. This way you&#8217;ll always be sure the needed variables are available.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="c">#!/bin/bash</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c">#Export the dbus session address on startup so it can be used by cron</span>
</span><span class='line'>touch <span class="nv">$HOME</span>/.Xdbus
</span><span class='line'>chmod 600 <span class="nv">$HOME</span>/.Xdbus
</span><span class='line'>env | grep DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS &gt; <span class="nv">$HOME</span>/.Xdbus
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s1">&#39;export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS&#39;</span> &gt;&gt; <span class="nv">$HOME</span>/.Xdbus
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># Export XAUTHORITY value on startup so it can be used by cron</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then you only need to set <code>cron</code> to do the job:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>
