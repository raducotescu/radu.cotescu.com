  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>UPDATE 4</strong>: Version 2.4 added support for printer models LBP6000 and LBP6018 and provides a better dependency handling. Please test it on older Ubuntu versions as it works perfectly on Ubuntu 11.04.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 3</strong>: Version 2.3 added support for Ubuntu 11.04.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2</strong>: Due to popular demand version 2.2 now supports Ubuntu 10.10. Use the exact same instructions to install and please leave a comment if anything fails.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 1</strong>: The currently used CAPT driver since version 2.0 is 2.00 which adds support for Canon LBP6300dn and Canon LBP9100Cdn. Also a new script has been added to the archive to handle the driver uninstall process.</p>

<p>After I bought <a href="http://radu.cotescu.com/geeks-and-their-computers/">Riker</a> , when it came to installing Ubuntu I had two options: either install the i386 version but with a PAE aware kernel, either go for the amd64 release. Considering the advantages and disadvantages of both of my options, I decided to go for the 64bit version (although the last time I did this I wasn&#8217;t quite happy – back in the 7.10 days). Anyway, Riker is extremely happy about it and I haven&#8217;t experienced any problems so far (I&#8217;m even running the 64-bit beta flash plugin which works great).</p>

<p>But let&#8217;s get back to the main point: Canon printers on 64bit Linux. While Canon does provide a Linux driver (both <code>*.deb</code> and <code>*.rpm</code> files), they are compiled to work only on a 32bit OS (which is like ½ Linux support). Therefore the only solution for the geeky misfortunate fellows like me is to compile their own drivers using Canon&#8217;s sources, but not following Canon&#8217;s instructions (which seem to be written by an unlucky lad who works at Microsoft but on UNIX services [this is a good joke if you are a geek]). While the process of compiling your own stuff is not very hard to accomplish (when you  <em>do</em> have the proper instructions), trying to do this without knowing the exact dependencies is a major pain in the ass.</p>

<p>Fortunately, one guy on Ubuntu forums managed to create a proper set of  <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1315665">steps</a> to follow in order to do the job right. If you followed my blog, there&#8217;s a slight chance you might have noticed that I like to build BASH scripts to automate tedious Linux things. Since that post helped me to create the two <code>*.deb</code> files needed for the job, I decided to build a script just for the install part, using the packages I compiled and created on my 64bit machine. Also, because I really like geeking around, I made the script to install the correct drivers both on 32bit and 64bit (this is automatically handled by the script).</p>

<p>The current supported printer models for the 1.90 release of the driver are: LBP-1120, LBP-1210, LBP2900, LBP3000, LBP3010, LBP3018, LBP3050, LBP3100, LBP3108, LBP3150, LBP3200, LBP3210, LBP3250, LBP3300, LBP3310, LBP3500, LBP5000, LBP5050, LBP5100, LBP5300, LBP7200C.</p>

<p>You can download the script from <a href="https://github.com/raducotescu/CanonCAPTdriver/tarball/master">here</a> (right click, save as, extract archive). Running the script is pretty easy:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>sudo ./canonLBP_install.sh PRINTER_MODEL
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>where <code>PRINTER_MODEL</code> is one from the above. Any other printer model you would try to use will give you an error message and the script will exit.</p>

<p>Please tell me how it worked. Have fun! :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>13 days ago I&#8217;ve bought another computer, thus reaching to number 3. My home network architecture is pretty simple:</p>

<p><a href="/uploads/wpuploads/2010/03/toys_smaller.png"><img src="/uploads/wpuploads/2010/03/toys_smaller.png" alt="Toys" /></a></p>

<p>As you might have noticed, my computers are named after <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em> characters. Let me describe them in their chronological order.</p>

<p>Picard is my former desktop which is now used primarily by my folks. Being an old timer, it&#8217;s the PC on which I&#8217;ve learned what&#8217;s Linux and on which I&#8217;ve developed several of my software projects from college. It still works okay, but comparing it with my latest acquisition, it&#8217;s slow and noisy.</p>

<p>Data was named like that because, at the time I bought it, it was the most powerful PC in the house, therefore resembling in a way with the famous android. I am still amazed by its capabilities when I compare the laptops available now in the same price range (it beats the crap out of them). My geekinees really emerged with the help of this machine, being capable of running Oracle DB, virtual machines, OC4J and many other power hungry appliances. It was the first machine on which, with the help of <a href="http://mac4lin.sourceforge.net/">Mac4Lin</a>, I began using the Mac OS X looks on an Ubuntu running computer (I never really quite liked the Human theme, nor any other default one). Since then all my machines share those looks (this will probably change with Ubuntu 10.04 which features an extremely nice looking theme, called Light).</p>

<p>Geordi is my beloved router, an Asus WL-500W draft N device which runs an alternate firmware that provides Samba and NFS access to the attached WD MyBook HDD, GIT (with gitosis), SVN, FTP, rTorrent (which accepts XML-RPC command through LIGHTTPD) and a dynamic DNS update client because my external IP is obtained using PPPoE. I&#8217;ve chosen Geordi as a name for the router because this device is responsible with the whole network and networking services, which is like The Engineering that La Forge led on the Enterprise. Also, the SSID for my wireless network is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Enterprise_%28NCC-1701-D%29">NCC-1701D</a> (the code used for the USS Enterprise in the previous mentioned Star Trek series).</p>

<p>Geordi and Data have been bought together from my first salaries as an intern at Oracle (the place where I&#8217;ve began to master Linux).</p>

<p>Darwin is my iPod Touch 2nd generation. Its name is pretty self explanatory and it&#8217;s the only one not related to Star Trek, although I&#8217;m thinking to change it in the near future in order to keep my hostnames consistent (any suggestions?). For the ones who still don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m talking about, check <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_%28operating_system%29">this</a> out.</p>

<p>And here we are to Riker (Number One). Even if now this machine is the most powerful computing device I own, I still won&#8217;t change the name of my laptop. Since no other character name from TNG was worthy for this machine (maybe with the exception of Worf), Riker seemed to be the most appropriate one. Bought primarily for use at my diploma project (which is still a secret to the public), this computer outperforms Data and Picard together when it comes to processing power. Also I&#8217;ve opted for the i7 and the LGA 1366 socket due to their high performance architecture and their (currently) slow rate of becoming outdated.</p>

<p>Now tell me, how do you name your machines? Do you have a clear naming strategy like I do (FYI my naming strategy respects <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc952">RFC 952</a>, <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123">RFC 1123</a> and <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1178">RFC 1178</a> [useful for non-geeks too])? :D</p>

<p>Launched almost one month ago, OpenOffice.org 3.2 will be available by default in Ubuntu in the 10.04 release. Of course, if you are eager to put your hands on it faster, you can check this <a href="http://radu.cotescu.com/how-to-install-openoffice-org-3-2-on-ubuntu/">article</a> I wrote a few weeks ago. Anyway, this post is about the latest issue of Linux Identity Office, a number dedicated to OOo 3.2.</p>

<p>Bringing a considerable number of new features and improvements, OpenOffice.org 3.2 has paved its way in becoming a solid competitor for Microsoft Office with the main advantages that it comes with absolutely no costs (it&#8217;s a free product) and it implements well documented open standards, offering you the best compatibility with any other office suite product. Furthermore, it has a great range of extensions, allowing its users to customize the product according to their own needs. Exposing a rich API, OOo can also be integrated into other products, offering the support of a well established office suite into almost any application that needs document or spreadsheet support.</p>

<p>The articles (and authors) featuring in this number are:</p>

<li><p>Tips for Microsoft Office users migrating to OpenOffice.org (me)</p></li>
</ol>


<p>After having read all the articles written by the other guys who contributed to this issue, I can tell you that all of them are great and have a good way of clearing out and explaining the work flow you should follow when dealing with OOo 3.2. Also, they represent a great way to learn what OpenOffice.org has so special about it that makes it a solid competitor to the expensive Microsoft Office suite.</p>

<p>The magazine is still under production but you can order it online. From the beginning of April it will also be available on the traditional press stands.</p>

<p>P.S. All of the articles have been created with OpenOffice.org. :D</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve promised to myself a few weeks ago that I wouldn&#8217;t talk about Apple&#8217;s iPad because a lot of bytes have been wasted for this subject by so many others (what about the ink levels?!). Although the subject isn&#8217;t new any more, the online journalists still talk and write about it like it&#8217;s the only thing that the people must hear of.</p>

<p>Of course, the fact that the iPad isn&#8217;t launched yet to the masses makes it a subject that still puts forth a lot of interest. So much interest, that now we see  <a href="http://www.geek.com/articles/apple/arm-says-to-expect-up-to-50-ipad-competitors-by-the-end-of-the-year-20100311/">news</a> about Apple&#8217;s competitors who want to build replicas with more features for a lesser price.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s set some things straight. I am not an Apple fan boy, nor am I a hater. I&#8217;ve owned an iPod Nano (4th generation; given away to one of my former high-school colleagues) which I really liked and now I own an iPod Touch (2nd generation). What I see looking at the iPad is just an overgrown iPod Touch with 3G capabilities (only for data traffic) that requires a separate service from the one you might already have been paying for. It&#8217;s not even what Apple&#8217;s marketeers call it: “The best way to experience the web”. Because of two simple things: the JavaScript engine from the mobile version of Safari and the lack of the Flash plug-in. While the first one might make you feel a bit weird when you would browse a web site with heavy JavaScript interaction (Facebook for example, when you choose to browse it using the desktop UI), the lack of Flash makes it “web navigability challenged” (without the slightest reference or association to people with disabilities).</p>

<p>Of course, Steve Jobs is a visionary man and he might believe that HTML 5 will soon be adopted as a standard, replacing Flash. While HTML 5 is in the &#8220;Last Call&#8221; state at the WHATWG (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Hypertext_Application_Technology_Working_Group">Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group</a>), Flash is still one of the most downloaded and used software products in the world. It&#8217;s virtually running on every machine that implements the desktop metaphor (desktops, laptops, notebooks, netbooks, etc.). Even if the new HTML standard will successfully replace Flash (and it&#8217;s something that I&#8217;m almost sure of but I&#8217;ve used  <em>if</em> to be on the safe side), this will take a while (a few years to be more precise). We still have websites that use the Transitional Document Type Definition, for crying out loud!</p>

<p>Going away from the software point of view to the physical one, the iPad&#8217;s dimensions are far from the ones of a mobile device (although Apple considers itself a mobile device manufacturer). Yes, it&#8217;s easy to carry it with you in a backpack or some sort of a leather wrapper, but it&#8217;s not the thing that you can carry in your pocket. It&#8217;s not something that you can take with you when you want to have your hands and back free. Considering this, with what is it better than a thin netbook with a great battery life (and we have several candidates here)? It sure doesn&#8217;t compute faster, it&#8217;s not easier to type with and you are constrained to use what Apple offers you, bad or good (OS, apps, default apps, etc.).</p>

<p>The iPhone and the iPod Touch were and still are some great devices (and I&#8217;m not going to enter into more details here). They have their market share and it was a logical thing to try to offer similar products when it comes to other competitors in the market (see the explosion of touchscreen smartphones in the last couple of years). Therefore I really don&#8217;t see the point of copying something like the iPad. Of course, some people will buy Apple&#8217;s tablet (be it Apple fan boys/girls or people who want to try it just out of curiosity). Still, why should you copy it? Just because it&#8217;s made by Apple? I don&#8217;t see manufacturers copying the Mac Pro (Apple&#8217;s flagship computing device), although as a device class it has a more successful selling potential.</p>

<p>I guess we&#8217;ll only have to wait and see what will happen. What do you think about the potential success behind tablets? I, for one, think they will die just like the PDAs did (a few years after their launch and quietly).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After Facebook announced its XMPP chat protocol support I decided to give it a try and use it since I already used Pidgin as my instant messaging client. The settings are simple but somehow the average user finds them after some tedious Google searches. Here are the steps you should follow for setting up Facebook&#8217;s chat in Pidgin:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>(if you already have a Facebook username skip this step) create your Facebook username by going to <em>Account » Account Settings</em> in your Facebook account;
<a href="/uploads/wpuploads/2010/03/account.png"><img src="/uploads/wpuploads/2010/03/account-300x148.png" alt="Facebook account settings" /></a></p></li>
<li><p>in Pidgin go to <em>Accounts » Manage Accounts</em> ([CTRL] + [A]) and click on <em>Add</em>;</p></li>
<li><p>use this information for your account:</p></li>
</ol>


<pre><code>protocol: XMPP
username: your Facebook username
domain:   chat.facebook.com
resource: your hostname (computer's name)
password: your Facebook account's password
local alias: your name
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>go to the <em>Advanced</em> tab and deselect <em>&#8220;Require SSL/TLS&#8221;</em>; the <em>connect port</em> should be <em>5222</em> and the <em>connect server</em> should be <em>chat.facebook.com</em> and everything else should be left blank (except for the custom smileys check-box which is optional);</li>
</ol>


<p><a href="/uploads/wpuploads/2010/03/add-account.png"><img src="/uploads/wpuploads/2010/03/add-account-199x300.png" alt="Add an account" /></a></p>

<p><a href="/uploads/wpuploads/2010/03/add-account-adv.png"><img src="/uploads/wpuploads/2010/03/add-account-adv-199x300.png" alt="Advanced account settings" /></a></p>

<ol>
<li><p>once you&#8217;re done click on <em>Add</em>;</p></li>
<li><p>in the <em>Accounts</em> window check the new created account.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Now play jokes on the people who are at work and waste their time on Facebook!</p>
