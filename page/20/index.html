  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/uploads/wpuploads/2009/04/ubuntu-old.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I am currently running Ubuntu 9.04 on two machines (as the single OS on my personal laptop and dual boot with Windows on my work desktop) and I will soon (by Sunday tops) have it installed on a third (my home desktop). This is probably my largest Ubuntu deployment, if I can call it like that and I would like to share my current user experience.</p>

<h3>Pros:</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>the upgrade alone (on my laptop) skimmed three to four seconds off my boot time using ext3 partitions, reaching to a merely 21 second boot race. I have decided to not convert my drives to the new ext4 while it doesn&#8217;t become the Ubuntu default installation formatting system. This performance is achieved after setting the concurrency variable to shell, making a profile for my own start-up scripts and after setting my partitions to use the data=writeback option;</p></li>
<li><p>with the upgrade to the new 2.6.28-11 kernel, my laptop&#8217;s Nvidia graphic card&#8217;s drivers have been successfully updated from 177 to 180.44. Even if the drivers were available before, they wouldn&#8217;t allow me to put my computer to stand-by and afterwards to wake it up;</p></li>
<li><p>the notifications now are well structured (basically they look decent now), with a plus regarding the wireless connections;</p></li>
<li><p>on my work desktop I have encountered a problem with the 8.10 version installation CD. My Dell Optiplex 755 has a DVD Writer SATA drive and Ubuntu 8.10 failed to install using a CD. I have tried this with a re-writeable disk burned at different speeds. The same problem was reported by many other on the web and from what I have managed to find out, most of the drives that had this issue were made by Samsung. The only viable way to install Ubuntu was using a stick. For this desktop I have decided that 9.04 should be installed from zero, as 8.10 wasn&#8217;t completely set up (I didn&#8217;t have the time). The installation was made from a CD with no problems. Everything worked like a charm. One nice thing to note is that the installation from a USB stick is done in approximately 6 minutes, comparing to 15 minutes for installing using a CD;</p></li>
<li><p>the CPU frequency applet that you can add to your panels I think that now has the option of choosing how your processor scales its performance. I say &#8220;I think&#8221; because I don&#8217;t remember if this feature existed before or not;</p></li>
<li><p>Ubuntu 9.04 comes with OpenOffice 3.0, instead of 2.4 by default. The most important functionality is the ability to open the new Open-XML standard documents from Microsoft Office 2007 (docx, xlsx, pptx).</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Cons:</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>last night I experienced a strange stall on my laptop. I still haven&#8217;t found out the cause for that but it was an isolated experience;</p></li>
<li><p>my laptop has a hardware switch for bluetooth and wifi. I have noticed that if I turn it off in 9.04 while my system is on, when I turn it back on my wireless card doesn&#8217;t reinitialize. It worked ok under 8.10. But if I put my laptop on standby after I set the switch to on and then I wake it up the card works. The bluetooth works ok though;</p></li>
<li><p>The quick function buttons for starting my browser and my email client don&#8217;t work anymore (one of them worked under 8.10) but this really doesn&#8217;t affect me as I haven&#8217;t used those shortcuts anyway. I am happy that my multimedia buttons still work ok (these are useful, the others mentioned before aren&#8217;t).</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Except for the wifi thing, everything works incredibly well and that is the main reason for which I am using Ubuntu on so many machines. I am actually considering installing a 4th Ubuntu system, but this time in a virtual machine, only for testing purposes. Linux, and Ubuntu especially, has migrated very nicely from the g33kish operating system to a more mainstream market starting with the 8.04 release and continuing to improve in this way up to 9.04.</p>

<p>P.S. The Windows at work is starting to be neglected as I can proudly say something that is written on <a href="http://radu.cotescu.com/wordpresswp-content/uploads/2009/04/UBN11005.jpg">one of the T-Shirts that I would like to have</a>: I do it with Ubuntu. :D</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://python.org"><img src="http://www.python.org/community/logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM.png?w=300" alt="Python Logo" /></a>I have recently discovered <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> and by recently I mean a few months (3 and a half). The discovery has been made after I was supposed to do a web application for a course at my faculty and it has been based on the fact that I wanted another programming language that would do the trick besides PHP. The only reason for not choosing PHP is its ugly syntax (mixing code with HTML) and the fact that everybody uses it. That might not be a very good criteria to chose from (because of the community support) but I am known to be stubborn as a mule. I have also discovered <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a>, a web framework written in Python. The project went smooth and everything turned fine.</p>

<p>My pal <a href="http://motane.lu">Tudor</a> has become a ZCE (Zend Certified Engineer) 2-3 weeks ago and he is very proud of that. He is what some of you may call a PHP guru, working for a great outsourcing company, <a href="http://www.zitec.com/zitec-team.html">Zitec</a> (working as of May 2009 at <a href="http://www.ninespices.com/">Ninespices</a>). We tend to sting ourselves from time to time with geeky remarks like &#8220;Python&#8217;s better than your sucky PHP&#8221; or &#8220;Gaython is okay for you&#8221; but after our egos have cooled down, Tudor said something true and realistic: Python doesn&#8217;t have a company that invests marketing and money behind it, like Zend does for PHP.</p>

<p>Of course, <a href="http://www.python.org/about/success/usa/">Python is used by NASA</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> for Gmail, Google Groups and Google Maps, <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo</a> for Yahoo Groups, in  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houdini_%28software%29">Houdini</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_%28software%29">Maya</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softimage_XSI">Softimage XSI</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueSpace">TrueSpace</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poser">Poser</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modo_%28software%29">Modo</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuke_%28software%29">Nuke</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blender_%28software%29">Blender</a>. It is also used in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIMP">GIMP</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krita">Krita</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inkscape">Inkscape</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scribus">Scribus</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paint_Shop_Pro">Paint Shop Pro</a>, it ships with most Linux distros, NetBSD, OpenBSD, MacOSX. Ananconda for <a href="http://www.redhat.com">Red Hat</a> and <a href="http://www.fedoraproject.org">Fedora</a> is written in it and so is Portage for <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo</a>, it&#8217;s even ported to <a href="http://www.symbian.com/index.asp">Symbian</a> and is in use by <a href="http://www.python.org/about/success/">many many others</a>. But that doesn&#8217;t suffice!</p>

<p>Java has Sun Microsystems. C# has Microsoft for backup. Python needs somebody who can invest in it more than just using it for great projects and writing a standard. I mean certifications, an official IDE (even though there are quite a few IDEs that support it like Eric, Quanta, Eclipse with the PyDev plug-in and others), manuals (not just a collection of docs; there is actually a <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/">well written tutorial</a>) and literature around it to support its growth in popularity. Its coolness itself won&#8217;t do the trick because in order for somebody to write in Python, they must know about it in the first place.</p>

<p>I will not list here all the brilliant things that Python has (and I must assure you that there are many). This is not my role. I just want to signal a problem that can be resolved easily and of which results we (programmers around the world) can all benefit from. As the title says, Python programmers, unite! Let&#8217;s do something to grow <a href="http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html">Python&#8217;s popularity</a>, let&#8217;s start building a certification system, let&#8217;s make it attractive to companies (both IT ones and potential customers). We have a lot of advantages over the competition. We just need to use them in an intelligent manner.</p>

<p>I hope that my cry will be heard!</p>
