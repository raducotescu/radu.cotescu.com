  <div class="entry-content"><p>Having to write an article dealing with a part of my diploma project for the <em>Students&#8217; Papers Session</em> in my University, I discovered that some fonts (particularly &#8220;ș&#8221; and &#8220;ț&#8221;) were displayed awkward in Writer, the word processing software from OpenOffice.org. By awkward I mean that &#8220;ș&#8221; and &#8220;ț&#8221; were using other fonts than &#8220;s&#8221; and  &#8220;t&#8221;. The strange thing is that this was happening only on my laptop, while on my desktop everything worked okay. Both these machines have the same software stack (Ubuntu 10.04 x86_64 and OpenOffice.org 3.2).</p>

<p>Browsing the web for a solution I couldn&#8217;t find anything pointing in the right direction. Still, what I&#8217;ve managed to observe was that on my laptop I had a <code>.fonts</code> folder in my home directory which seemed to contain the exact font I was using in Writer (and that was stored in the system fonts folder too). When I looked on my desktop for that specific folder, surprise: there wasn&#8217;t any. While this folder keeps user specific fonts, the main folder where the fonts are kept for the entire system is <code>/usr/share/fonts</code>. I&#8217;ve then decided to delete the <code>.fonts</code> folder from my home directory (I still don&#8217;t know what created it) and then I&#8217;ve regenerated the font cache, using this command:</p>

<p>&#8220;` bash</p>

<p>Now everything is back to normal in my font world. Maybe I&#8217;ll use LaTeX when it&#8217;s time to write the real deal.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Booting Ubuntu from an USB stick is both fast and convenient: <em>fast</em> because an USB stick definitely has better R/W speeds than CDs, <em>convenient</em> because you can alter those files for how many times you want without buying several storage mediums (you could use a CD-RW, but that still would be slow). Nowadays USB sticks have become cheaper and offer much more GB/$ than they used to, so it&#8217;s not unusual to find affordable flash pens with 2+ GB storage space. Considering that an Ubuntu LiveCD has about 700MB, putting that on a 2GB flash pen will leave you with almost 1.3GB unused space. Wouldn&#8217;t that be a shame?</p>

<p>Of course, USB sticks can have multiple partitions (but not on Windows - and guys &amp; girls, this is a <em>feature</em>, not a <em>bug</em>). While using your pen&#8217;s 2 partitions wouldn&#8217;t be a problem on Linux, this certainly is a debatable subject on Windows. Let&#8217;s make it clear: <strong>Windows only sees the first partition of a removable drive</strong>. What&#8217;s the solution if you want to use your USB stick for storage too?</p>

<h3>How to</h3>

<p>My stick for this job is a 4GB <a href="http://www.patriotmemory.com/products/detailp.jsp?prodline=7&amp;catid=27&amp;prodgroupid=64&amp;id=630&amp;type=11">Patriot Xporter XT Boost</a>, which is a pretty fast beast. I am assuming that you are working with Ubuntu (installed on your machine or running from a LiveCD, the differences are minimal). The tools used for the job are <em>GParted</em> and <em>Ubuntu Live USB Creator</em>. While the latter comes by default in Ubuntu, the former is only present on the LiveCD but can be installed easily:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install gparted
</code></pre>

<p>The first step consists of creating the necessary partitions on your stick. Insert your stick to an USB port and open <em>GParted</em> (<em>System » Administration » Gparted</em>). Now select your USB pen (on my machine this is <code>/dev/sdg</code>) and delete all the available partitions. After this your stick should look like in screenshot 1.</p>

<p>[caption id=&#8221;attachment_1313&#8221; align=&#8221;aligncenter&#8221; width=&#8221;300&#8221; caption=&#8221;GParted Unallocated Space&#8221;]<a href="/uploads/wpuploads/2010/05/gparted-1.png"><img src="/uploads/wpuploads/2010/05/gparted-1-300x231.png" alt="GParted Unallocated Space" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>Next you have to create the STORAGE partition <em>and then</em> the UBUNTU partition (screenshots 2, 3 and 4), where the UBUNTU partition should have about 714MB.</p>

<p>[caption id=&#8221;attachment_1314&#8221; align=&#8221;aligncenter&#8221; width=&#8221;300&#8221; caption=&#8221;GParted - creating the STORAGE partition&#8221;]<a href="/uploads/wpuploads/2010/05/gparted-2.png"><img src="/uploads/wpuploads/2010/05/gparted-2-300x231.png" alt="GParted - creating the STORAGE partition" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>[caption id=&#8221;attachment_1315&#8221; align=&#8221;aligncenter&#8221; width=&#8221;300&#8221; caption=&#8221;GParted - Creating the UBUNTU partition&#8221;]<a href="/uploads/wpuploads/2010/05/gparted-3.png"><img src="/uploads/wpuploads/2010/05/gparted-3-300x231.png" alt="GParted - Creating the UBUNTU partition" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>[caption id=&#8221;attachment_1316&#8221; align=&#8221;aligncenter&#8221; width=&#8221;300&#8221; caption=&#8221;GParted - final partition layout&#8221;]<a href="/uploads/wpuploads/2010/05/gparted-4.png"><img src="/uploads/wpuploads/2010/05/gparted-4-300x231.png" alt="GParted - final partition layout" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>Then start <em>Ubuntu Live USB Creator</em> (<em>System » Administration » Startup Disk Creator</em>). Select your Ubuntu image/CD and from the partitions listed in the bottom frame select the one labelled UBUNTU (if your stick appears like <code>/dev/sdg</code>, this partition should be <code>/dev/sdg2</code>). By using the second partition for Ubuntu you assure yourself that you can use your stick for storing files on the first one using Windows machines (this also protects your second partition against accidentally being written by a Windows user). Once you&#8217;ve made these choices, click on <em>Make Startup Disk</em> and wait for the process to finish.</p>

<p>[caption id=&#8221;attachment_1317&#8221; align=&#8221;aligncenter&#8221; width=&#8221;300&#8221; caption=&#8221;Ubuntu Live USB Creator&#8221;]<a href="/uploads/wpuploads/2010/05/usb-creator-1.png"><img src="/uploads/wpuploads/2010/05/usb-creator-1-300x236.png" alt="Ubuntu Live USB Creator" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>To boot a machine using your newly created Live stick, change the BIOS settings accordingly. This can vary from selecting the first boot device to be a Removable one, or setting your first hard disk to be your flash pen (this depends on the system to be booted). Now not only that you have a stick from which you can boot and install Ubuntu in a breeze, you also can use that extra space for platform independent storage.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A great man once said:</p>

<blockquote><p>Only wimps use tape backup: <em>real</em> men just upload their important  stuff on ftp, and let the rest of the world mirror it ;)</p></blockquote>

<p>While it works for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Torvalds">him</a>, for us pure mortals this trick doesn&#8217;t get the job done. That&#8217;s why we <em>have</em> to use backups. Protecting your data is important. It&#8217;s almost vital that you keep a copy of your most important files in case your primary storage medium just dies on you. Or even worse: it gets hacked. Following my post about <a href="http://radu.cotescu.com/securing-wordpress-from-the-ground-up/">securing WordPress</a>, I thought that when my blog got hacked I was lucky to have those files backed-up on my hard-drive which let me reduce the downtime involved by moving my blog to another host. I say lucky because only providence made me make a backup copy to my hard drive.</p>

<p>Since then I&#8217;ve decided to automate the backup process and this resulted in a beautifully crafted BASH script which should get the job done for everyone having a web hosting account with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPanel">cPanel</a>, one of the most popular web hosting administration panels. The script relies on the existence of several configuration files:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>main configuration file - holding global settings like the backup folder, log file, etc.;</p></li>
<li><p>domain configuration file - a file for every domain a user holds on different accounts/servers with specific data for logging into cPanel and downloading the home directories and MySQL databases (add-on domains data can be downloaded with the primary domain&#8217;s). This file should have the same name as the domain (e.g. example.com).</p></li>
</ol>


<p>For detailed information about setting up the system I encourage you to read the included <code>README</code> file and the comments from the configuration files. To run the script you just need to have the files set up according to your needs and call it like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>./getCPANELbackups.sh
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Of course you can fully automate your backups by creating a CRON job to call the script like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>00 00 * * * /path/to/script/getCPANELbackups.sh
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Since the domain configuration files hold sensible data (users and passwords) it&#8217;s better to assure that no other user on your system has access to them. This means that you must set up the file permissions to 600 (read/write only for your account):</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>chmod 600 example.com
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>For any complaints or feature requests, please drop a comment on this page. Backup often!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My <a href="http://radu.cotescu.com/hosted-by-hostgator/">move</a> to <a href="http://secure.hostgator.com/~affiliat/cgi-bin/affiliates/clickthru.cgi?id=raducotescu">HostGator</a> was partly due to the fact that on my old host this blog got hacked. And judging by the impact, I suspect this was a server-side security breach because my DB was intact. Since then I&#8217;ve spent some time to secure my WP instance as much as I could given the available tools on a shared hosting account.</p>

<p>While <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Hardening_WordPress">this</a> guide provides you a lot of information, it&#8217;s not diving into more detailed explanations. To sum it all up and to add some geeky stuff too, I recommend considering the following advice.</p>

<h3>Choose a secure host</h3>

<p>Assure that your hosting provider is secure: its servers are protected by unauthorized access, they <em>do</em> provide back-ups and they offer you a decent line of support services.</p>

<h3>Choosing passwords</h3>

<p>Use <em>strong</em> passwords: this is the most common overlooked aspect when it comes to security. Avoid your birth date, phone number, girlfriend&#8217;s / boyfriend&#8217;s name (unless it&#8217;s a very weird and uncommon name :D), etc. Avoid using every combination that could be guessed by people you know (it&#8217;s not paranoid, it has to protect your online space and therefore nobody but you should have access).</p>

<h3>Use up-to-date software</h3>

<p>Keep your WordPress engine and its plug-ins always up-to-date. This is pretty basic and helps you avoid security bugs that might exist in older versions.</p>

<h3>Secure your file transfers</h3>

<p>Avoid <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTP">FTP</a> as much as you can: it&#8217;s <em>not</em> secure. Sure: it&#8217;s fast, it&#8217;s convenient and you might have a built-in client on your OS. But this doesn&#8217;t make it secure at all. Ask your host to provide you SSH access (this will be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot">chrooted</a> into your home folder) to be able to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_file_transfer_protocol">SFTP</a>.</p>

<h3>File permissions</h3>

<p>Once you have set up your WordPress blog take care of file permissions (yes, it&#8217;s basic stuff, but again people overlook it). All your folders must have 755 permissions and all your files should have 644. Take special consideration for the <code>wp-config.php</code> file which is recommended to have 750 (on my server it has 600) and all the <code>.htaccess</code> files which should be writeable by the user under which your web server runs if you want WordPress and other plug-ins to able to modify them for you (permalinks, caching plugins, etc.).</p>

<h3>Secure wp-admin</h3>

<p>Protect your <code>wp-admin</code> folder using at least an <code>.htaccess</code> file for authentication (Basic HTTP Authentication). Another option is to use the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/askapache-password-protect/">AskApache Password Protection plugin</a>, but it doesn&#8217;t work on all hosts and several people have reported problems using it. To secure this folder with <code>.htaccess</code> you can use your hosting&#8217;s web administration panel (e.g. cPanel, Plesk, etc.) or you can directly upload the file having the following contents:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>ErrorDocument 401 default
</span><span class='line'>AuthType Basic
</span><span class='line'>AuthName <span class="s2">&quot;Use your imagination here&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>AuthUserFile <span class="s2">&quot;/path/that/is/upper/than/public_html/passwd&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>require valid-user
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you used  the web administration panel to do this, edit the generated <code>.htaccess</code> file in your <code>wp-admin</code> folder to include the first line from above, otherwise you will be locked-out of your Dashboard. If you haven&#8217;t used the web administration panel you must upload the <code>passwd</code> file which contains the user and the password you want for accessing any content from <code>wp-admin</code>. You can generate this file using <a href="http://web9.2020media.com/other/htpasswd.jsp">this</a> online script. The logic of keeping the passwords file outside of the directory used to serve content is to protect it from the outside world.</p>

<h3>Useful security plug-ins</h3>

<p>Personally I use four plug-ins which help me keep this blog clean of unwanted access:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/login-lockdown/">Login LockDown</a> - this plug-in protects your blog from brute-force attacks on your login form. It can be set to block IPs from which several unsuccessful logins are performed. You can set the number of failed logins after which the IP should be blocked, the maximum number of minutes to allow unsuccessful login tries from the same IP and the number of minutes that the IPs should be blocked if breaching the first two rules.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/secure-wordpress/">Secure WordPress</a> - this plug-in hides certain information that your blog reveals and that might be used by hackers. Take care regarding the option labelled <code>index.php</code> because on some servers it might cause some problems where the server automatically requests itself for that file.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/exploit-scanner/">WordPress Exploit Scanner</a> - useful to search for potential security breaches in your WordPress&#8217; files, plug-ins and themes.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-file-monitor/">WordPress File Monitor</a> - one of my favourites. This one checks if any changes have happened to your files while you were gone. It might cause some false alarms when you update  plug-ins of other files but if a hacker managed to alter your scripts you will find out soon enough (through email or notices on your Dashboard) and you can track which files he&#8217;s been playing with, making your recovery fast and clean.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Another plug-in which can be used to track requests made to your server (although its main purpose is to show you statistics about your visitors) is <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/statpress/">StatPress</a>. Using the database entries it creates, you can efficiently look through the records using the basic form it provides under its Search option or, if you know SQL, you can build custom queries to run against your DB to find out more.</p>

<h3>Extra</h3>

<p>If you think you have discovered some traces of an attack on your blog (fishy or bot-net requests) and you can clearly identify some specific data about the requests made (user-agent, IP, requests for certain files which shouldn&#8217;t be accessed directly), you can add these rules to the <code>.htaccess</code> file at the root of your blog:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="c"># Hunting spammers</span>
</span><span class='line'>    RewriteEngine   on
</span><span class='line'><span class="c">#   RewriteCond     %{HTTP_REFERER}    ^$</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c">#   RewriteCond     %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} ^$</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c">#   RewriteCond     %{REQUEST_URI}     ^/denied/path/(.*)</span>
</span><span class='line'>    RewriteRule     ^<span class="o">(</span>.*<span class="o">)</span><span class="nv">$ </span>    http://%<span class="o">{</span>REMOTE_ADDR<span class="o">}</span>/      <span class="o">[</span>L,E<span class="o">=</span>nolog:1<span class="o">]</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Uncomment which rules you want to be used and edit them so that they catch what you need (a certain referrer, user-agent or a certain request). The result is that the &#8220;spammer&#8221; is given his own dog food in return without filling your server log with crap. It&#8217;s good to put this section at the beginning of your file so that if a spammer tries to do something bad, it will be redirected to his own IP without the server trying to parse the rest of the rules. Take care not to block access to your blog.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>No matter how hard you try to keep your WordPress clean, there always is a slight chance that somebody some way will hack it. Although what I&#8217;ve tried to resume and present here are definitely show stoppers for your average hacker / script kiddie, it&#8217;s not as safe as not powering on any machine (from clients to servers). You will always be exposed to risk. The secret is to prevent any known chance of access without your consent.</p>

<p>Stay clean! :)</p>

<p>From Sunday, April 25th, this blog is hosted by <a href="http://secure.hostgator.com/~affiliat/cgi-bin/affiliates/clickthru.cgi?id=raducotescu">HostGator.com</a> due to some problems I have had with my hosting provider from Romania. Therefore I am sorry for the hiccups and downtimes you might have experienced that day and until Monday evening EET (UTC-2). From now on the downloads available from my Codebin (codebin.cotescu.com) are served by GitHUB because all my open-source code is there. If by any chance you see an URL requesting data from the Codebin but serves you a 404 error (page not found) please let me know. I have done my best to redirect all those URLs to the corresponding repository on GitHUB.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time and patience!</p>
