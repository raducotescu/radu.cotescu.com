  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since I&#8217;m against upgrading my systems to Ubuntu 9.10, when it comes to the OpenOffice.org office suite I am stuck with the 3.0 version from Jaunty&#8217;s repositories. Therefore, if I want to put my hands on a newer release of OpenOffice the only way to do this is to use the packages provided by Oracle (Sun was acquired by Oracle).</p>

<p>The process of installing OpenOffice.org from other packages than the ones from the repositories is not very complicated, but it might not come in handy for new users. It&#8217;s good to know though that the 3.2 release of OpenOffice will be available on Ubuntu 10.4 (codenamed Lucid Lynx) due to appear this year in April. But if you want to use the latest version available, here&#8217;s what you have to do:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Download OpenOffice.org from <a href="http://download.openoffice.org">here</a> (make sure to download the DEB package for your system&#8217;s architecture - 32/64 bit). At the moment of writing this post, the 3.2 release is still in RC stage (release candidate 4).</p></li>
<li><p>Before installing the new version, remove your existing OpenOffice.org installation using <em>Synaptic</em> or <em>Add/Remove&#8230;</em></p></li>
<li><p>Extract the downloaded archive and open a terminal into the resulting folder.</p></li>
<li><p>Browse to the <code>DEBS</code> sub-folder from that directory.</p></li>
<li><p>Install OpenOffice.org 3.2 by issuing the following command:</p></li>
</ol>


<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">cd </span>desktop-integration
</span><span class='line'>sudo dpkg -i --force-overwrite *deb
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You are all done. OpenOffice.org 3.2 is installed on your machine and all the file associations have been set up automatically. To see a complete list of the new features for this latest release go <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/dev_docs/features/3.2/rc2.html">here</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After I had installed Firefox 3.6 on my Ubuntu machines I noticed that when I would want to open the FTP bookmarks saved in Nautilus those targets would open in tabs from Firefox. The problem with this approach was that I couldn&#8217;t edit files (create, update, delete) the way I could with Nautilus. After some diggings I found out that this change in behavior was due to the fact that at some point I chose Firefox to be the default browser (which was something fully assumed because it&#8217;s my favorite browser). Doing this associates Firefox as the handler for <code>ftp://</code> links instead on relaying that part to Nautilus.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the solution for this problem doesn&#8217;t have a graphical approach. It&#8217;s not something you choose in your Preferred Applications. Instead one has to edit the <code>%gconf.xml</code> file located in the <code>~/.gconf/desktop/gnome/url-handlers/ftp</code> folder and make it look like this:</p>

</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/gconf&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The important line here is the one located between the <code>stringvalue</code> tags. I just hope that in the next versions of GNOME these kind of things will be easier to maintain by providing a GUI for the user. This is one aspect that Linux still has to improve. It won the servers, but let&#8217;s make it reach the desktops too.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some of you might know that the CPUs available these days adjust their frequency according to your computing needs, allowing you to save power by not using the maximum capacity of your processor if there isn&#8217;t such a need. Of course, this happens only when your operating system includes the software needed to access this feature. From Wikipedia we can find out what&#8217;s the impact of using the dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) (named SpeedStep by Intel, respectively Cool&#8217;n&#8217;Quiet or PowerNow! by AMD):</p>

<p>The power consumed by a CPU with a capacitance <em>C</em>, running at frequency <em>f</em> and voltage <em>V</em> is approximately
P = CV<sup>2</sup>f
For a given processor, <em>C</em> is a fixed value. However, <em>V</em> and <em>f</em> can vary considerably.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s take my desktop&#8217;s processor for example, an Intel Pentium 4 631@3.0 GHz with Hyper Threading. Looking on the processor&#8217;s page info, one can find out that the voltage may vary between 1.200V and 1.3375V, while the frequency varies between 2.4 GHz and 3.0 GHz (if the processor wasn&#8217;t overclocked). With this data, the maximum power ratio that can be obtained is 3.10 (Pmax / Pmin). Now the maximum TDP (Thermal Design Power) for it is about 86 W. If the processor would be scaled at the minimum speed, it will drain only 27.74 W. That qualifies for a 58.26 Wh economy if the processor runs at the lowest speed for one hour, or if we put this in standard power consumption units, that would be 0.058 kWh. Of course, this represents ideal data because nobody buys a 3.0 GHz processor to use it only at a 2.4 GHz speed.</p>

<h3>What has MicroMiser got to do with this?</h3>

<p>Well, the guys from MiserWare, the company behind MicroMiser, implemented some super secret algorithms (I&#8217;m kidding, but these are their intellectual property) that can save power more efficiently than just by using your operating system&#8217;s power schemes, whether it&#8217;s Windows or Linux. Therefore, by using their daemon, you could save more power without having to do anything more than just install MicroMiser (which is free for personal use). On their FAQ page (where you can reach only after you register - for free again) they provide a nice power saving calculation based on their program. The conclusion is that MicroMiser can help you save between 10% and 30% more power, where the average is somewhere near 25%.</p>

<p>On my Ubuntu desktop I&#8217;ve started the MicroMiser daemon for about one hour and I am sure that my processor&#8217;s frequency hasn&#8217;t gone up to 3.0 GHz because I&#8217;ve only browsed  some websites without annoying flash banners. If I check the log (on Linux MicroMiser doesn&#8217;t have a shiny GUI yet) I can see that I&#8217;ve saved about 0.01 kWh just by automatically launching this application without any other supplementary steps. Pretty cool, huh?</p>

<p>Launching the same application on Windows offers me a nice GUI where I can check the cumulative power savings or the ones predicted for one year, see different equivalents of the energy saved (including CO2 emissions), set the amount of money (in US dollars or in Pounds) per kWh and many others. Now really, was it so hard to write a GUI for Linux using GTK+ 2 or any other widget toolkit given the fact that we talk about power saving algorithms (far more complicated than some frames)?</p>

<p><a href="/uploads/wpuploads/2010/01/micromiser-time.png"><img src="/uploads/wpuploads/2010/01/micromiser-time-196x300.png" alt="MicroMiser - 1Yr estimate" /></a></p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<p>Because I haven&#8217;t monitored my computers&#8217; efficiency until now (at least not my desktop) I am not able to say if this application seems to do a better job than the already implemented power managers from different OSs. Still, judging by the fact that the product is offered for free for personal use but only with a license for companies I tend to believe that the algorithms behind it really do what advertised. Though I think that I can find out about this by installing the application on my laptop on which I reach to a maximum of 1h30&#8217; of battery use after a full charge, using on demand processor speed (the laptop is 1yr and 3 months old and used daily for about 5 to 8 hours).</p>

<p>I really like the fact that MicroMiser&#8217;s CPU and memory necessities are unobservable both on Windows and on Linux. Even if I do like to use the terminal on Linux to do things faster, for this kind of application I would have really enjoyed a GUI instead of having to filter the output from the log files (even if it&#8217;s a one-liner command).</p>

<p>In order to be able to install the application you have to register <a href="https://secure.miserware.com/account/signup/?ref=traspusuthophistispeprefrumehe">here</a>. Since MicroMiser is still in beta, every feedback you provide back to MiserWare will be useful. For Windows there&#8217;s an entry for that in the Programs&#8217; menu. For Linux just open a terminal and type <code>sudo mw-feedback</code>. Only some data regarding your system and the association of that system with your account will be sent over.</p>

<p>How much did you save?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong><strong><strong>UPDATE 3</strong>: </strong>The  script and patches have been updated to also support kernel 2.6.38. For  older kernel releases please download the archive from <a href="https://github.com/raducotescu/vmware-server-linux-2.6.3x-kernel/tree/release-1.5">here</a> (temporary fix until I will unify the solutions).</strong></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2</strong>: <strong>The script and patches have been updated to also support kernel 2.6.35.</strong></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 1</strong>: <strong>The script should also work with 2.6.32 kernels from version 1.2.</strong></p>

<p>Seeing the success I have encountered with the <a href="http://radu.cotescu.com/how-to-install-vmware-server-2-0-x-on-ubuntu-9-10-karmic-koala/">blog post about installing VMware Server on Ubuntu Karmic Koala</a> and helped by <a href="http://risesecurity.org/">Ramon de Carvalho Valle</a> with a better patch regarding the installation of the virtualization server on the newer kernels found in three of the most popular Linux distributions - Ubuntu, Fedora and openSUSE - I&#8217;ve managed to provide a script which should be able to install the server on all of these distros. Furthermore, by placing some trivial checks in a function of the script one may enlarge the applicability to a lot more distributions with common roots (Debian and all Debian-based distributions, Red Hat and all of its derivatives).</p>

<p>I have managed to test the script on both the 2.6.31-14 and 2.6.31-17 kernels which can be found in Ubuntu 9.10 and on the 2.6.31.9-174.fc12 kernel found in Fedora 12. Since I didn&#8217;t have an openSUSE machine I am not sure of what is the outcome on this distribution (regarding the kernel sources; people who commented previously on my blog had no problems installing VMware Server using the previous script) but the script is made so that it automatically determines on what kind of distribution is run and according to this information it automatically installs the needed packages. Careful though, as this requires Internet access for the specific machines.</p>

<p>The good news regarding Ramon&#8217;s patch is the fact that <strong>now VMware Server seems stable</strong>. No more warnings appear when compiling modules, except for <code>vsock</code>, which - miraculously - builds on Fedora.</p>

<p>Regarding the installation of VMware Server on Fedora, I have encountered some difficulties after the installation completed successfully. Basically I wasn&#8217;t able to log into the web administration interface because of multiple factors. The steps which should be followed will be reminded to the Fedora users after the script completes but I&#8217;m gonna mention them here too:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>edit <code>/etc/services</code> and replace the entry located on TCP/902 port with <code>vmware-authd</code></p></li>
<li><p>disable SELinux it by editing the <code>/etc/selinux/config</code> file (permissive mode isn&#8217;t enough - see comments)</p></li>
<li><p>reboot your system</p></li>
</ol>


<p>The general instructions are the same as the ones for the previous version of the script.</p>

<h3>How to</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Download VMware Server (<a href="https://www.vmware.com/freedownload/p/download.php?product=server20">2.0.1</a> or <a href="http://www.vmware.com/download/server/getserver.html">2.0.2</a>) - gz format, <em>not</em> rpm. Whichever version you choose, keep the license key near.</p></li>
<li><p>Download my script from <a href="http://github.com/raducotescu/vmware-server-linux-2.6.3x-kernel/tarball/master">here</a> (right click, save as, extract archive).</p></li>
<li><p>Run the script with super user rights either in the same folder where you have downloaded the server archive, either by providing it the path to that folder. <strong><em>Make sure the folder where you have downloaded the server&#8217;s archive doesn&#8217;t contain spaces in its path name or the script will exit (giving you this reason as an error message)</em></strong>. If the script exists, it will give you a decent warning from which you should be able to tell what’s wrong. On Ubuntu at least, the VSOCK module will not work (will fail to compile), giving you a hint that your kernel sources might not be the ones for your running kernel. This is not true, as the script takes care of this before doing the hard work. Anyway, VMware Server will work without it. Example:</p>

<pre><code> chmod +x vmware-server-2.0.x-kernel-2.6.3x-install.sh
 sudo ./vmware-server-2.0.x-kernel-2.6.3x-install.sh [PATH _TO_VMWARE_ARCHIVE]
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>When you are asked about adding users to the server, if you do not provide your own account, the user used for login in the web console of the server will be <em>root</em> (maybe you <em>should</em> add yourself there).</p></li>
<li><p>Provide the license key when asked about it.</p></li>
<li><p>For the ones installing Windows guests in VMware Server, you must pick one of the following two solutions to avoid having problems with the mouse in the console:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>you run the <code>start-VMware-console.sh</code> in the terminal every time you want to launch a VMware Server console, but after you have installed the VMware plug-in for Firefox</p></li>
<li><p>you export this variable in the environment right after login such that it will be set before starting Firefox:</p>

<pre><code>  VMWARE_USE_SHIPPED_GTK=yes
</code></pre></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>If the solution worked well for you please share this info wherever you can. :D</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I am looking forward for your feedback because running the script and the server under multiple kernel versions and distributions will provide the real way to see if this latest patch really handles all the flaws in VMware Server or not. And if it does, this means that Ramon and I (but mostly Ramon) can shout a big &#8220;In your face, VMware!&#8221;.</p>

<p>P.S. All my open-source work can also be found on <a href="http://github.com/raducotescu">GitHUB</a>. This is useful if you think that you have some other non up to date versions of my scripts. Anyway, the scripts which can be found on my server represent the latest version.</p>
