<time datetime="2010-10-19T22:15:49+03:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Oct 19<span>th</span>, 2010</time>
        
      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I was faced with the challenge of using two JVMs on the same machine. And let me tell you that whenever you have to do this, things get dirty. Basically I was forced to install an additional 32-bit JVM for <a href="http://www.event-b.org/platform.html">Rodin</a>, the IDE we use at faculty for Event-B modelling, because the developers of the platform (which is actually a modified Eclipse) decided not to support the 64-bit architectures (LAME!).</p>

<p>Installing a 32-bit JVM on a machine that already has a 64-bit JVM installed will change the default JVM to be the last one installed. Since all of my Java programs and application were made for 64-bit, it was a mayhem on my machine. The solution is rather simple (but, oh, so uncomfortable). You would have to change the default JVM back to the 64-bit one and build some wrapper scripts for all the 32-bit apps to use the correct JVM for them.</p>

<p>Changing the defaults is done in this way:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>sudo update-alternatives --install <span class="s2">&quot;/usr/bin/java&quot;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;java&quot;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/bin/java&quot;</span> 1
</span><span class='line'>sudo update-alternatives --set java /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/bin/java
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The first line will instruct your system that there&#8217;s another Java version available (the old one) while the second line will make it the default version of JVM.</p>

<p>For Rodin, the wrapper script is pretty trivial, since it&#8217;s nothing more than a modified Eclipse IDE:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="c">#!/bin/bash</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">WHERE</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="sb">`</span>dirname <span class="nv">$0</span><span class="sb">`</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$WHERE</span>/rodin -vm /usr/lib/jvm/ia32-java-6-sun/bin/java
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Everything should be working okay now but don&#8217;t forget to instruct the 32-bit apps to use their dedicated JVM. Anyway, keep in mind that this is an ugly hack. If you&#8217;re a developer you should better package your apps for all the available architectures and not force your user-base to do this kind of hacks. Don&#8217;t forget though that this happens only when some system dependent libraries are used (as is the case for Rodin).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Two days ago Ubuntu 10.10 was released. Since I don&#8217;t want to upgrade yet to the new release - I am currently running 10.04 - I decided to try Maverick (the code name for the latest release) in a VirtualBox virtual machine.</p>

<p>The installation process went fine (it&#8217;s just point and click) and I do like the new wizard&#8217;s screens. Usually the next step for any virtual machine would be to install VirtualBox Guest Additions in order to be able to use higher resolutions, mouse integration, seamless integration and all the other geeky goodies. From my previous experiences, to install the Guest Additions into a virtual guest, one was supposed to click on <em>Devices Â» Install Guest Additions&#8230;</em> in VirtualBox&#8217;s guest window and then to launch the autorun script from the virtual CD. Well, that used to work until now.</p>

<p>For Ubuntu 10.10 the process has to be slightly altered for a successful installation of the additions. This means that once you install Ubuntu in your VM you have to make sure that two other packages are installed in your guest before you use the instructions provided in the previous paragraph. The packages are <code>build-essential</code> and the linux headers for your running kernel. To install these two packages the quickest way would be to open a terminal (the GUI alternatives would be Ubuntu Software Centre and Synaptic Package Manager, but it will take you longer) and issue the following commands:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>sudo apt-get update
</span><span class='line'>sudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-<span class="sb">`</span>uname -r<span class="sb">`</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Remember that <em><strong>these two packages have to be installed in your guest</strong></em>. Afterwards you proceed with the usual way of installing the additions.</p>

<p>Have fun!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>jQuery is one of the greatest JavaScript frameworks with plenty of documentation for just about everything one can do with it. In my latest project I have used jQuery extensively for any UX aspect: form validations, dialogs, error messages, AJAX, UI, etc.</p>

<p>A feature that I would really like to see implemented on all HTML forms is the ability to submit the form by using the Return key as well. I am sure that there are a lot of users who really like to keep their hands on the keyboard as much as possible, without using the mouse just to click a button or without hitting the TAB key in order to focus on the submit button after which to press Return. Some of the particularities of my project are the fact that it uses Struts2 and the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/struts2-jquery/">Struts2 jQuery plugin</a>. This plugin allows developers either to use the <code>.jar</code> embedded JavaScript libraries or to automatically get the required files from Google&#8217;s servers (CDN). In July, when my project was using Oracle 11G and TopLink everything worked okay. Now, after I have migrated the project to open-source solutions (MySQL and EclipseLink) I have noticed that whenever I tried to create a new account into the application I would get 2 submits for one action. At first I thought that this had something to do with EclipseLink. After some debugging I actually found out that it was a JavaScript issue (it is possible that now I&#8217;m using another jQuery UI release).</p>

<h2>The problem</h2>

<p>The code responsible for the issue is the following:</p>

<p>What I have discovered is that the <code>.click()</code> handler actually binds itself to keyboard events too, not only mouse events. This means that if the user presses the Return button the event will be identified with a click event.</p>

<h2>The solution</h2>

<p>Even though if the behaviour mentioned previously is unexpected (who would have thought that a click event would be triggered by the keyboard even if the focus is not set on the submit button?!), there are two ways of avoiding it in the code above:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>eliminate the <code>.keyup()</code> handler because pressing on the Return button will be considered a click event;</p></li>
<li><p>alter the first bind for the <code>.click()</code> handler like this:</p></li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Web feeds, as many of you surely know by now, represent a data format under which frequently updated content from various sources is provided to readers (the humans reading the content). The purpose of the web feed is therefore to inform the user of new or updated content originating from a source. Generally speaking web feeds contain HMTL mark-up for the content, on top of an XML document which is parsed by feed readers (the programs used to read web feeds).</p>

<p>Since a web feed is usually a standard feature for any web site that displays articles (by which we understand blog posts, news, press releases, etc.), the number of clients (software programmes) for this job has experienced a constant growth. From web applications, such as Google Reader, to desktop dedicated programs, such as Liferea, or Internet browsers, we have a multitude of ways for accessing web feeds. Because the primary function of the feed is to inform of the new content, the important attributes (sections) of the feed should be the title of the article in question, the author, date of publishing and the full text or the summarized one.</p>

<h2>&#8220;To summarize or not to summarize? That is the question.&#8221;</h2>

<p>What is more important for you and your readers: to serve them the full content (with the risk of them not being necessarily interested) or to give them just a hint of what you&#8217;ve published and let them to decide if they want to read it or not?</p>

<p>The advantage of offering the full content in the web feed is given by the fact that from a user&#8217;s standpoint the only action that he (or she) should perform is to open the reader and select your feed. Unfortunately this is also a disadvantage. Why? Because some of the content might be extending on a number of pages and some of the readers (the people) might not be interested in it, although the article&#8217;s category might be of interest. This leads to a cancelling of the benefits a feed might offer. I am sure that there are a lot of users who only read a small portion of the syndicated articles, which means that they have to get past the articles which are of no interest. This usually means scrolling over various amounts of content to select only the articles which are to be read in full.</p>

<p>Summarized feeds though offer only an introductory paragraph from the content itself. Sure, if the user needs to read more he (or she) has to access the source directly. But since the act of subscribing and receiving a feed&#8217;s content implies having access to the bid bag Internet, one more click for an interesting topic is just a small price to pay (both in effort and in time lost with the action). After all, your website has a nice theme for attracting readers (and probably you have invested time, money and energy on the user interface aspect of your site - web designers, CSS code, JS for user interaction, etc.). By not inviting the user to browse your website you loose not only traffic (although in recent times feeds are counted as an important communication channel with easy to follow traffic indicators), but the purpose of the shiny user interface. If all of your content is available through a web feed, why should we mind to visit it?</p>

<h2>Personal experience</h2>

<p>After several months of using a dedicated desktop application for syndicating the feeds I read I&#8217;ve switched to Google Reader. I won&#8217;t discuss here the advantages or disadvantages of one over the other. The end result in my case are 14 feeds under 5 categories (from geek stuff to more down to earth information). Out of the hundreds of articles which are published on a daily basis, I probably read about a quarter (maximum). This means that about 75% of the content to which I have access to I choose to skip over: either I am not interested (in which case I skip the content almost without retaining the title for more than 2 seconds) or I don&#8217;t think that the topic deserves more attention that what a short glimpse at one of its paragraphs might offer me. Imagine now the time lost with scrolling over full content from 75% of about 300 articles. Is it nice? NO! Is it reader-friendly? NO! This is why I prefer summarized feeds: I read the title to decide if the content is relevant and if so I don&#8217;t mind browsing to the source to read it all. I mean if I have the time to check what&#8217;s been published I am sure that I will make some time to read what&#8217;s interesting.</p>

<h2>In conclusion&#8230;</h2>

<p>Think of your users before putting the full content of your next article in the feed. There are chances that not all of your articles really hit the spot. By using summarized feeds you&#8217;ll more often than not win loyal and constant readers. Let them choose what they like from you instead of filling their screens with nonsense. Sure, they still have to click on the title to reach to your website. However, if your content is good, the readers will come by themselves.</p>

<p><em>SUMMARIZE YOUR FEEDS, PLEASE!</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After enrolling to the University of Southampton Software Engineering MSc programme the iSolutions department (responsible with the IT infrastructure) provided me with an user account to be able to access all the facilities. The account also has an email address attached, which happens to be hosted by a Microsoft Exchange Server. And here the &#8220;conflict&#8221; begins. The University advises all its undergraduates or taught postgraduates to use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlook_Web_Access">OWA</a> web application or the University&#8217;s portalÂ (which actually uses an iFrame to display the contents of OWA) to access their email accounts while the other students (research ones) and staff are allowed (and by this you must understand that iSolutions offers support for this) to use an email client.</p>

<p>I have never been a fan of using webmail. One of the reasons for this is the inability of such clients to provide all the features a desktop client. Since I use Ubuntu, I also couldn&#8217;t have accessed the full OWA application because I do not use IE (it&#8217;s against my beliefs to use such a lousy piece of software), leaving me with a limited webapp. Fortunately, I am a geek. My favourite email client is Thunderbird, which unfortunately cannot connect directly to Microsoft Exchange like Evolution (this is explicable through the partnership between Novell and Microsoft; in this particular case not even Evolution was able to connect to the server - the server version is unsupported). The only protocols available in Thunderbird are POP3 (old, blunt and poor as a solution regarding the number of mail capable devices I own), IMAP and SMTP. Even though I could have checked my University email using IMAP (they have enabled IMAP access on the Exchange Server), I couldn&#8217;t have accessed the Contacts or the Calendar features. The solution?! <em><strong>DavMail</strong></em>.</p>

<h2>DavMail</h2>

<p><a href="http://davmail.sourceforge.net/">DavMail</a> is a gateway between the OWA and whatever email client one uses. Written in Java, the application maps several ports on the localhost to the services offered by the Exchange Server. Since ports lower than 1024 need root access on UNIX and UNIX-like machines in order to be able to bind applications to them, DavMail usually uses the original protocol&#8217;s port numbers plus 1000 (e.g. 1110 for POP, 1143 for IMAP, 1025 for SMTP, 1080 for Caldav and 1389 for LDAP) but these settings are fully customizable.</p>

<p><a href="/uploads/wpuploads/2010/08/davmailArchitecture.png"><img src="/uploads/wpuploads/2010/08/davmailArchitecture-300x198.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Other nice features of DavMail include the ability to use the IDLE feature of the IMAP protocol to let the server push the messages to the client (this improves speed and network efficiency by reducing the number of queries made by the client to poll for new messages), the option to bind DavMail to an IP address for remote access for other &#8220;Exchange-impaired&#8221; clients, the auto-expunge IMAP feature (allowing for faster message deletions), logging and many more&#8230; The only Exchange feature that cannot be made available to Thunderbird 3 users is accessing the Contacts saved for one account (the personal address book created on the server). Still, this can be easily overcome by using the local address book from Thunderbird or using the information provided by a LDAP, since in most corporate environments all the needed contacts are stored this way.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s interesting about DavMail is that being only a layer, all the security is handled by the email client. Therefore you can&#8217;t compromise your accounts because of it. The setup is pretty straightforward and all of the Exchange features work as if using a dedicated client. I expected LDAP searching to be slow since we have a gateway between the client and the server, but it wasn&#8217;t the case. All the queries were fast and keep in mind that my University&#8217;s LDAP database is large (approximately 24000 students plus staff).</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>I wish Thunderbird could have offered Exchange support out of the box. Yes, it&#8217;s a Microsoft technology, but there seems that there are many adopters. Would I have liked it more if the University of Southampton used Google Apps? You bet! But since the only solution to access my account via a desktop client is using DavMail I actually have no complaints. I am happy that the program works okay, fast and that it is extremely easy to set up. Of course, if the server which holds your account doesn&#8217;t have the OWA service active you are toasted. Otherwise DavMail is just one cool little Java program.</p>
