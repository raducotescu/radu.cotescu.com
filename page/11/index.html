  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Google Chrome</h3>

<p><img src="/uploads/wpuploads/2009/12/google-chrome-150x150.jpg" alt="Google Chrome" /></p>

<p>Two days ago, on December 9th, Google has launched the beta version for its Chrome browser for Linux and Mac machines. For the ones having Chrome already installed in Ubuntu by using the <code>google-chrome-unstable package</code>, they can switch to <code>google-chrome-beta</code> without loosing any of their settings. For the ones wanting to install the browser, you have two solutions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>follow my post from <a href="http://radu.cotescu.com/google-goodies-in-ubuntu/">here</a> regarding how to add Google&#8217;s repos in Ubuntu and then install the beta package;</p></li>
<li><p>go to Google&#8217;s Chrome <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/index.html?hl=en">page</a> and select the corresponding package for your distribution</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Another great feature of the new beta is the ability to install extensions, both from Google and third-party developers. Check these pages for that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions">https://chrome.google.com/extensions</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.chromeextensions.org/">http://www.chromeextensions.org/</a></p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Thunderbird 3</h3>

<p><img src="/uploads/wpuploads/2009/12/thunderbird-150x150.jpg" alt="Thunderbird" /></p>

<p>Also on December 9th, Thunderbird 3 has been released. There are a lot of differences between the new release and the 2.x series. To mention just a few of them we now have tabbed browsing, message indexing for all of your folders (e.g.: it&#8217;s possible to search for a mail that contains certain words, not just by subject / author), it now supports automatic configuration of your mail account by only supplying data about your account (username, password) and your mail servers (incoming and outgoing) - although it failed to discover the Google Apps settings for my domain, trying to set the account according to the mail servers located at my ISP provider (which means that it doesn&#8217;t look for MX records when doing this, but for mail servers&#8217; replies).</p>

<p>One another noteworthy addition to Thunderbird 3 is an attachment reminder, a thing for which I cried when I replaced Evolution with Thunderbird on the desktop I used at my workplace where I sent a message or two in which I was talking about reports attached but I would forget to actually attach them.</p>

<p>For a complete list of new features, check the informations from <a href="http://www.mozillamessaging.com/en-US/thunderbird/features/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Two extensions that I highly recommend in case you are using Google applications like Contacts and Calendar would be <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/8451">gContactSync</a> and Lightning (Calendar synchronization tool) but which I recommend to be installed by using the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/4623">Lightning Nightly Updater</a> extension, due to the fact that the official version of Lightning doesn&#8217;t yet support the new Thunderbird.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Thunderbird 3 is not yet in Ubuntu&#8217;s repositories, but you can download it from its official <a href="http://www.mozillamessaging.com/en-US/thunderbird/">site</a>. Extract the archive in <code>/opt</code> and start it first with the profile manager option</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>/opt/thunderbird/thunderbird-bin -ProfileManager
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>and guide it to your existing Thunderbird 2 profile (if that&#8217;s applicable to you) so that you won&#8217;t lose your old emails. Afterwards, create your symbolic links to <code>/usr/bin/thunderbird</code> and you are set to go. If you uninstall the old version, you should recreate your menu entries.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve started using Linux since the 6.10 release of Ubuntu. More precisely the Edgy Eft release. I remeber that at that time I&#8217;ve been actually using Kubuntu. The learning curve was a bit steep, as it was really something new for me. And every time I would experience troubles I left Linux to rot away on its partition. This was happening mostly because I had a relatively new video card on my desktop and NVIDIA&#8217;s support for Linux was just beginning.</p>

<p>The things evolved and at the 7.10 release I think I&#8217;ve switched to Ubuntu and never came back to Kubuntu. I appreciated GNOME&#8217;s simplicity and ease of use and KDE was starting to prepare important changes in its desktop philosophy and this, corroborated with the fact that due to the problems I had with my video card I still could have been considered a new user, made me a bit reluctant to another set of changes besides trying to learn how to make my way with the new OS. By now I already started to know the basic commands which started to make the terminal a completely useful mean to do certain things faster than just by using a nice GUI.</p>

<p>When 8.04 was released (my first LTS) I could handle most of the stuff an above average user could have wanted to do. But the real Linux experience was boosted by my first internship in the summer of 08 when the web-based project I had to work on was hosted on a RHEL server. I was using Putty to handle administration (yeah, I had Windows on my work desktop). Anyway, it was the time when I have started to build my very first shell scripts that made backups and restores. The backups were stored on a NFS export and they were rotated every week. At some point we switched from RHEL to OEL (Oracle Enterprise Linux) but there weren&#8217;t major differences in what concerned me.</p>

<p>Close to the 8.10 release I bought myself a laptop on which I still had a dual boot set up, with Windows XP and Ubuntu 8.04. After the upgrade to 8.10 I decided to leave the Windows world and switch completely to Linux. Since then, even if on the desktop at home I have Windows 7 too (mainly for my parents who ocasionally use the computer), I never came back to use Windows.</p>

<p>When I bought the laptop I also bought an Asus WL-500W router (<a href="http://vlad.nastasiu.com">Vlad</a> called it R2D2) and soon after a 320GB My Book Western Digital HDD which was hooked to one of the router&#8217;s USB ports. I bought the router knowing that it runs Linux and that there is an alternative firmware customised for it so that it could unleash its full potential. Since my Linux experience continued to grow, I&#8217;ve started customizing my router&#8217;s OS to handle a lot of stuff by configuring and administering a lot of servers and services. So, on a Broadcom4704 chipset with 32MB of RAM I am now running the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>OpenSSH server - SSH daemon</p></li>
<li><p>SAMBA - for sharing the external HDD with Windows hosts</p></li>
<li><p>NFS - for sharing the external HDD with Linux hosts, being faster than using SAMBA</p></li>
<li><p>rTorrent behind lighttpd - a BitTorrent client behind a web server (for accepting XML-RPC requests)</p></li>
<li><p>ddclient - a Perl implementation of a dynamic DNS updating client for the DNS-O-MATIC service (I have a dynamic DNS host that points to my router&#8217;s dynamic IP via PPPoE)</p></li>
<li><p>vsftpd - FTP server for sharing various files with different people (more than 100)</p></li>
<li><p>SVN server - the SCM tool I used before GIT (it still holds some previous projects for me that weren&#8217;t migrated yet to GIT and I think it has the latest revision of my girlfriend&#8217;s diploma project [she should know this better than me as she has her own SVN account])</p></li>
<li><p>GIT and gitosis - the current SCM tool I use with gitosis for easier handling of repositories (I don&#8217;t have to actually log in to the router to administer them like I had to do when using SVN)</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I couldn&#8217;t have obtained this much functionality without using Linux.</p>

<p>I even worked on an Ubuntu desktop on my second internship (the sole developer from there embracing Linux), where I have started to develop J2EE applications. Moreover, my system was far more productive to work with than the Windows XP ones of my colleagues&#8230; Not to talk about the looks. :)</p>

<p>Now I run Ubuntu 9.04 identically configured on three different machines and the software stack I have offers me a complete desktop experience, from enjoying multimedia content, to playing some games when I get bored, editing various documents and developing software. More than that, my systems are fast performers on average hardware, are stable and allow me to configure various aspects regarding how they work pretty easy. What more could I ask from a free operating system and a free software stack?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s true that you have to learn how your new Linux system works, but given the advantages don&#8217;t you think that this thing really worths investing some time?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://wave.google.com"><img src="/uploads/wpuploads/2009/12/google_wave_logo.jpg" alt="Google Wave" /></a>Like all the g33k5 out there, I have a Google Wave account. I haven&#8217;t really got the chance to use it since I had no one to talk to, except <a href="http://vlad.nastasiu.com">Vlad</a>, from whom I originally got the invitation (Thank you, dude!). Anyway, opening my Wave account this evening, more out of curiosity and to dust it a little, I have noticed that I&#8217;ve received a Wave from Google with 16 invitations which I can send to anybody I want to. So, fellow geeks, if you think that you really want to use Wave, the email&#8217;s killer in Google&#8217;s opinion, please drop a comment here with your real email address and I will invite you to the system.</p>

<p>You must know from the beginning that the invitations are not sent instantaneously and that you might have to wait a while before you receive them. Please leave a comment here only if you really think you will use Google Wave, otherwise you might blow the chance of somebody else to enter the Wave&#8230;</p>
