  <div class="entry-content"><p>Twitter became a trend nowadays when almost everything important is being found out via this social-networking micro-blogging service. And now with Google&#8217;s real time search-results that includes tweets too, Twitter is recognised as a powerful platform by even the Internet&#8217;s giant. Since your (and mine too) online presence might include a few tweets a day, in a moment of total boredom, I decided to write a simple Python script that would update your Pidgin&#8217;s status with the latest tweet from your account.</p>

<p>Using the same principle as the script I wrote for <a href="http://radu.cotescu.com/python-and-pidgin-status-on-ubuntu-linux/">updating Pidgin&#8217;s status with a random post from your blog&#8217;s feed</a>, this new script uses as well a feed (the one provided by Twitter to every user), only that this time only the latest tweet will be set as status. Replies are ignored and therefore if your latest Twitter interaction is a reply, the script will search for the latest tweet which is <em>doh</em> not a reply. Because hash-tags represented a problem when trying to set Pidgin&#8217;s status the hash signs (#) are eliminated.</p>

<p>To properly use the script, the following steps should be followed:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>download the script from <a href="https://github.com/raducotescu/pidgin-status-scripts/tarball/master">here</a> and save it to your <code>~/bin</code> directory (if the directory doesn&#8217;t exist, create it)</p></li>
<li><p>make it executable</p>

<pre><code> chmod +x twitterize_pidgin_status.py
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>setting your DBUS session parameters requires exporting some variables to your environment. You can use the included <code>export_x_info.sh</code> script by saving it to the same <code>~/bin</code> directory; make it executable and add it via <em>System – Preferences – Startup Applications</em> to the list of programs that start at log in. This way you’ll always be sure the needed variables are available;</p></li>
<li><p>edit your crontab to make the script check for updates as often as you wish (every 5 minutes in this example)</p>

<pre><code> SHELL=/bin/bash
 DISPLAY=:0.0
 */5 * * * * source ~/.Xdbus; ~/bin/twitterize_pidgin_status.py your_twitter_feed
</code></pre></li>
</ol>


<p>Now the only thing that remains to do is to tweet. Have fun!</p>

      <p class="meta">
        








  


<time datetime="2009-12-17T22:58:17+02:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Dec 17<span>th</span>, 2009</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Starting to work on my diploma project my setup required that I installed Oracle 10g XE and OC4J. For a while now Oracle has started to offer <code>*.deb</code> packages and to host a repository for Debian-based Linux distributions, which means that they have gained the maturity to be used in enterprise environments.</p>

<p>The installation of both servers is painless, unless you want them on the same machine (which actually should be avoided unless you have powerful hardware). But if that&#8217;s the only way to have them, you must avoid setting the <code>ORACLE_HOME</code> environment variable required by OC4J because it will mess with the scripts used to start / stop the DB server. Instead create the <code>ORACLE_HOME</code> variable only inside the <code>bin/oc4j</code> script inside OC4J&#8217;s installation folder.</p>

<p>Keeping that as an important side note, to install those two servers follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Oracle Database 10g Express Edition</p>

<ul>
<li><p>add Oracle&#8217;s repository to your <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> file</p>

<pre><code>  echo -e "\n# Oracle repository\ndeb http://oss.oracle.com/debian unstable main non-free | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>get the key for the repository</p>

<pre><code>  echo -e "\n# Oracle repository\ndeb http://oss.oracle.com/debian unstable main non-free | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>update your packages information</p>

<pre><code>  sudo apt-get update
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>install the database (I recommend using the universal package so that you get Unicode character support)</p>

<pre><code>  sudo apt-get install oracle-xe-universal
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>configure the DB instance</p>

<pre><code>  sudo /etc/init.d/oracle-xe configure
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>to administer the DB either use the menu entries from <em>Applications - Oracle Database 10g Express Edition</em>, either use the scripts from <code>/usr/lib/oracle/xe/app/oracle/product/10.2.0/server/config/scripts/</code></p>

<pre><code>  sudo adduser your_user dba
</code></pre></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>OC4J</p>

<ul>
<li>download one of the OC4J containers from <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/products/ias/htdocs/utilsoft.html">here</a></li>
<li>extract the archive where you want to have the server installed (let&#8217;s call this <code>OC4J_HOME</code>)</li>
<li><p>change the file permissions for <code>$OC4J_HOME/bin/oc4j</code> to 744</p>

<pre><code>  chmod 744 $OC4J_HOME/bin/oc4j
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>edit the script located at <code>$OC4J_HOME/bin/oc4j</code> so that right after the configuration section you have something like:</p>

<pre><code>  #########################################################
  ########## START CONFIGURATION SECTION ##################
  #########################################################

  ORACLE_HOME=OC4J_HOME
  J2EE_HOME=$ORACLE_HOME/j2ee/home
</code></pre></li>
</ul>


<p> but replace <code>OC4J_HOME</code> with the actual folder path</p>

<ul>
<li>start the server and add the credentials for the <code>oc4jadmin</code> user</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>


<p>If you used the default ports for both installations, you can access the OC4J EM at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8888/em">http://127.0.0.1:8888/em</a> and the DB at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8080/apex">http://127.0.0.1:8080/apex</a> (note that <a href="http://radu.cotescu.com/how-to-install-oracle-application-express-312-on-oracle-database-10g-xe/">APEX</a> is not installed).</p>

<p>Start developing!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Google Chrome</h3>

<p><img src="/uploads/wpuploads/2009/12/google-chrome-150x150.jpg" alt="Google Chrome" /></p>

<p>Two days ago, on December 9th, Google has launched the beta version for its Chrome browser for Linux and Mac machines. For the ones having Chrome already installed in Ubuntu by using the <code>google-chrome-unstable package</code>, they can switch to <code>google-chrome-beta</code> without loosing any of their settings. For the ones wanting to install the browser, you have two solutions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>follow my post from <a href="http://radu.cotescu.com/google-goodies-in-ubuntu/">here</a> regarding how to add Google&#8217;s repos in Ubuntu and then install the beta package;</p></li>
<li><p>go to Google&#8217;s Chrome <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/index.html?hl=en">page</a> and select the corresponding package for your distribution</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Another great feature of the new beta is the ability to install extensions, both from Google and third-party developers. Check these pages for that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions">https://chrome.google.com/extensions</a></p></li>

<h3>Thunderbird 3</h3>

<p><img src="/uploads/wpuploads/2009/12/thunderbird-150x150.jpg" alt="Thunderbird" /></p>

<p>Also on December 9th, Thunderbird 3 has been released. There are a lot of differences between the new release and the 2.x series. To mention just a few of them we now have tabbed browsing, message indexing for all of your folders (e.g.: it&#8217;s possible to search for a mail that contains certain words, not just by subject / author), it now supports automatic configuration of your mail account by only supplying data about your account (username, password) and your mail servers (incoming and outgoing) - although it failed to discover the Google Apps settings for my domain, trying to set the account according to the mail servers located at my ISP provider (which means that it doesn&#8217;t look for MX records when doing this, but for mail servers&#8217; replies).</p>

<p>One another noteworthy addition to Thunderbird 3 is an attachment reminder, a thing for which I cried when I replaced Evolution with Thunderbird on the desktop I used at my workplace where I sent a message or two in which I was talking about reports attached but I would forget to actually attach them.</p>

<p>For a complete list of new features, check the informations from <a href="http://www.mozillamessaging.com/en-US/thunderbird/features/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Two extensions that I highly recommend in case you are using Google applications like Contacts and Calendar would be <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/8451">gContactSync</a> and Lightning (Calendar synchronization tool) but which I recommend to be installed by using the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/4623">Lightning Nightly Updater</a> extension, due to the fact that the official version of Lightning doesn&#8217;t yet support the new Thunderbird.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Thunderbird 3 is not yet in Ubuntu&#8217;s repositories, but you can download it from its official <a href="http://www.mozillamessaging.com/en-US/thunderbird/">site</a>. Extract the archive in <code>/opt</code> and start it first with the profile manager option</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>/opt/thunderbird/thunderbird-bin -ProfileManager
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>and guide it to your existing Thunderbird 2 profile (if that&#8217;s applicable to you) so that you won&#8217;t lose your old emails. Afterwards, create your symbolic links to <code>/usr/bin/thunderbird</code> and you are set to go. If you uninstall the old version, you should recreate your menu entries.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve started using Linux since the 6.10 release of Ubuntu. More precisely the Edgy Eft release. I remeber that at that time I&#8217;ve been actually using Kubuntu. The learning curve was a bit steep, as it was really something new for me. And every time I would experience troubles I left Linux to rot away on its partition. This was happening mostly because I had a relatively new video card on my desktop and NVIDIA&#8217;s support for Linux was just beginning.</p>

<p>The things evolved and at the 7.10 release I think I&#8217;ve switched to Ubuntu and never came back to Kubuntu. I appreciated GNOME&#8217;s simplicity and ease of use and KDE was starting to prepare important changes in its desktop philosophy and this, corroborated with the fact that due to the problems I had with my video card I still could have been considered a new user, made me a bit reluctant to another set of changes besides trying to learn how to make my way with the new OS. By now I already started to know the basic commands which started to make the terminal a completely useful mean to do certain things faster than just by using a nice GUI.</p>

<p>When 8.04 was released (my first LTS) I could handle most of the stuff an above average user could have wanted to do. But the real Linux experience was boosted by my first internship in the summer of 08 when the web-based project I had to work on was hosted on a RHEL server. I was using Putty to handle administration (yeah, I had Windows on my work desktop). Anyway, it was the time when I have started to build my very first shell scripts that made backups and restores. The backups were stored on a NFS export and they were rotated every week. At some point we switched from RHEL to OEL (Oracle Enterprise Linux) but there weren&#8217;t major differences in what concerned me.</p>

<p>Close to the 8.10 release I bought myself a laptop on which I still had a dual boot set up, with Windows XP and Ubuntu 8.04. After the upgrade to 8.10 I decided to leave the Windows world and switch completely to Linux. Since then, even if on the desktop at home I have Windows 7 too (mainly for my parents who ocasionally use the computer), I never came back to use Windows.</p>

<p>When I bought the laptop I also bought an Asus WL-500W router (<a href="http://vlad.nastasiu.com">Vlad</a> called it R2D2) and soon after a 320GB My Book Western Digital HDD which was hooked to one of the router&#8217;s USB ports. I bought the router knowing that it runs Linux and that there is an alternative firmware customised for it so that it could unleash its full potential. Since my Linux experience continued to grow, I&#8217;ve started customizing my router&#8217;s OS to handle a lot of stuff by configuring and administering a lot of servers and services. So, on a Broadcom4704 chipset with 32MB of RAM I am now running the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>OpenSSH server - SSH daemon</p></li>
<li><p>SAMBA - for sharing the external HDD with Windows hosts</p></li>
<li><p>NFS - for sharing the external HDD with Linux hosts, being faster than using SAMBA</p></li>
<li><p>rTorrent behind lighttpd - a BitTorrent client behind a web server (for accepting XML-RPC requests)</p></li>
<li><p>ddclient - a Perl implementation of a dynamic DNS updating client for the DNS-O-MATIC service (I have a dynamic DNS host that points to my router&#8217;s dynamic IP via PPPoE)</p></li>
<li><p>vsftpd - FTP server for sharing various files with different people (more than 100)</p></li>
<li><p>SVN server - the SCM tool I used before GIT (it still holds some previous projects for me that weren&#8217;t migrated yet to GIT and I think it has the latest revision of my girlfriend&#8217;s diploma project [she should know this better than me as she has her own SVN account])</p></li>
<li><p>GIT and gitosis - the current SCM tool I use with gitosis for easier handling of repositories (I don&#8217;t have to actually log in to the router to administer them like I had to do when using SVN)</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I couldn&#8217;t have obtained this much functionality without using Linux.</p>

<p>I even worked on an Ubuntu desktop on my second internship (the sole developer from there embracing Linux), where I have started to develop J2EE applications. Moreover, my system was far more productive to work with than the Windows XP ones of my colleagues&#8230; Not to talk about the looks. :)</p>

<p>Now I run Ubuntu 9.04 identically configured on three different machines and the software stack I have offers me a complete desktop experience, from enjoying multimedia content, to playing some games when I get bored, editing various documents and developing software. More than that, my systems are fast performers on average hardware, are stable and allow me to configure various aspects regarding how they work pretty easy. What more could I ask from a free operating system and a free software stack?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s true that you have to learn how your new Linux system works, but given the advantages don&#8217;t you think that this thing really worths investing some time?</p>
