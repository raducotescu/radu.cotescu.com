  <div class="entry-content"><p>I noticed a few days ago that my Facebook XMPP chat account from Pidgin had stopped working, popping up a weird error message: &#8220;Not authorised&#8221;. This happened even though I did not change any of the account&#8217;s settings.</p>

<p>The resolution is pretty Voodoo or, how <a href="http://web.nastasiu.com">Vlad</a> described it, the error needs a Microsoft-type fix. Apparently if you are logged in on Facebook using your email address instead of the user name, the XMPP protocol might not authenticate you. Therefore, if you&#8217;d like to use Facebook&#8217;s chat on third-party clients while you&#8217;re still logged on in a browser, make sure you always log in using your user name instead of your email address on Facebook&#8217;s site. Trying to use your email address in Pidgin for the user name field results in an error, as email addresses are not valid XMPP user names.</p>

<p>Weird!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have never been an Adobe fan and something tells me that I won&#8217;t change my mind soon. One of the main reasons for which Linux had problems being a &#8220;normal&#8221; operating system for a quite long period of time (although there were other issues as well, but not as visible at this one) was that the Flash Player never really worked very well on this platform. Time passed and things began slowly to advance, however users of the 64-bit version of the Linux kernel had to use various hacks to run a 32-bit browser because of Flash.</p>

<h2>A little bit of history (and personal experience)</h2>

<p>Only when it reached version 10 Adobe managed to issue a native 64-bit version of their Flash plug-in for Linux, but it was a Labs attempt and therefore not considered a stable release. Still, it was the best way to enjoy Flash content on a 64-bit platform, even though there wasn&#8217;t a nice and easy way to install it (get an archive from Adobe, extract the <code>.so</code> file from it, and then using <code>sudo</code> move it to the proper location using the terminal). Nevertheless, everything worked smoothly, even 1080p videos in full screen, as long as you had a decent machine. Yeah, Flash is power hungry (not quite news&#8230;).</p>

<p>It didn&#8217;t last long until Adobe found out that version 10.0 had a major security bug, which led to the release of version 10.1. But because Linux users were (and probably still are) a negligible quantity, version 10.1 didn&#8217;t contain a 64-bit release for this platform. The &#8220;official&#8221; reasons were that Adobe wanted to work on version 10.2 which unified several technologies and therefore did not have to time to work on a Linux release. And then again, in order to avoid the security bugs, Linux users had to use the 32-bit Flash player wrapped with 32-bit compatible libraries on their 64-bit systems. And hell broke loose ever since because running Flash videos in fullscreen was a matter of luck, randomness and Adobe&#8217;s willingness to test video cards drivers.</p>

<p>Although <a href="http://radu.cotescu.com/geeks-and-their-computers/">Riker</a> has pretty powerful hardware components, a Flash video in fullscreen made it look ridiculous. Flash 10.2 (this time a native 64-bit release) didn&#8217;t seem to handle the problem better. Annoyed by such a trivial thing, I have started to look for a fix. It was weird that things were working with 10.0 and then degraded with newer releases. I know that my video driver hasn&#8217;t been updated since then, which clearly meant that the problem was on Adobe&#8217;s side.</p>

<h2>The fix</h2>

<p>Apparently, on UNIX (and consequently Linux) machines, the Flash player can read settings from two files:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>mm.cfg</code> - a file residing in each user&#8217;s home directory with per user settings</p></li>
<li><p><code>mms.cfg</code> - a file residing in <code>/etc/adobe</code> which sets things for the whole machine</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Because Flash uses its own mechanism to check for video card compatibility and then runs animations according to it, on some drivers it might fail to read properly the OpenGL specs of the card, which in turn leads to crappy performance in fullscreen (lags, unresponsiveness, browser crashes, etc.). To override the internal compatibility check (which Adobe says that might lead to crashes; ironic, isn&#8217;t it?!), one has to add a setting in the mms.cfg file:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">OverrideGPUValidation</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nb">true</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Once this is done, simply restart your browser and check how things are working. You might have a nice surprise. It&#8217;s amazing though how until 10.1 things were working as they should have without this override.</p>

<p>If by any chance that file, or even the <code>adobe</code> folder, is missing, use these commands:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>sudo mkdir /etc/adobe <span class="c">#in case the folder is missing</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;OverrideGPUValidation=true&quot;</span> | sudo tee /etc/adobe/mms.cfg
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Let&#8217;s hope though that 10.3 won&#8217;t require something more esoteric.</p>

      <p class="meta">
        








  


<time datetime="2011-02-18T20:13:52+02:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Feb 18<span>th</span>, 2011</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are a lot of tutorials online that will tell you how to secure your SSH server. Most of them will tell you not to allow the <code>root</code> account to login, to use only keys for authentication and possibly to change the port on which your server listens from 22 to any other. Although this is valid advice, there are times when due to zealous system administrators you <em>have</em> to use port 22 (because along with 21 and 80 it&#8217;s not blocked and you <em>do</em> like to check your server from time to time). Also, you might still want to use password authentication together with public and private keys just because there are chances that you might lose your keys (it happens to the best of us). Combine these two and you are exposing your server to a lot of brute-force attacks from various script kiddies.</p>

<p>If your SSH server (generally OpenSSH) is compiled to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_Wrapper">TCP Wrapper</a> you can use <a href="http://denyhosts.sourceforge.net/">DenyHosts</a> to protect yourself against the annoying attempts to hack the server. However, if you don&#8217;t have the option to use a TCP Wrapper aware SSH server (which happens to be the case on almost all Linux distributions made to operate home-class routers), you&#8217;re pretty much on your own. Unless you&#8217;d like to use another script I wrote while I was bored.</p>

<p>The script analyses your SSH daemon&#8217;s log, identifies IPs from which there are unauthorized access attempts (the attackers usually try to login using a multitude of user/password combinations - brute-force attacks) and then denies all traffic from those IPs. Also it keeps a list of all those pesky &#8220;hackers&#8221; for times when you reboot (the part where you re-add those IPs to your <code>iptables</code> configuration is left as an exercise to you). The cherry on top of the cake is that for every bad IP the script tries to mail the ISP with the relevant parts from your log (in case you have configured <code>sendmail</code> or another MTA with a <code>sendmail</code> interface).</p>

<p>As usual, you can find the script in one of my GitHUB <a href="https://github.com/raducotescu/SSHBruteForceLogger">repos</a> with a nice README file giving you all the juicy configuration details.</p>

<p>If you can improve the script to do even more, please fork the repo. Also, if you find any bugs please let me know.</p>

<p><strong>TIP</strong>: if your kernel can use the recent module, you can add some rules like these:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -m state --state NEW -m recent --set --name SSH
</span><span class='line'>iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -m state --state NEW -m recent --update --seconds 60 --hitcount 8 --rttl --name SSH -j LOG --log-prefix <span class="s2">&quot;SSH_brute_force &quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -m state --state NEW -m recent --update --seconds 60 --hitcount 8 --rttl --name SSH -j DROP
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This would assure that a user cannot open more than 8 connections in 60 seconds to your server on port 22. Of course, if the user tries to open a ninth connection, <code>iptables</code> will block the access for 60 seconds. This is just an extra measure to protect your server in addition to the script.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t let the &#8220;hackers&#8221; win!</p>
