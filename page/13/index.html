  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today Ubuntu celebrates its 5th birthday. And it only took them 1 year, until 2005, to become the first shought-after Linux distributuion according to <a href="http://www.distrowatch.com">DistroWatch.com</a>. The releases until now were:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Ubuntu 4.10 (Warty Warthog) - October 20 2004</p></li>
<li><p>Ubuntu 5.04 (Hoary Hedgehog) - April 8 2005</p></li>
<li><p>Ubuntu 5.10 (BreezyBadger) - October 12 2005</p></li>
<li><p>Ubuntu 6.06 LTS (Dapper Drake) - June 1 2006</p></li>
<li><p>Ubuntu 6.10 (Edgy Edft) - October 26 2006 - My first Linux, and it was a Kubuntu</p></li>
<li><p>Ubuntu 7.04 (Feisty Fawn) - April 19 2007</p></li>
<li><p>Ubuntu 7.10 (Gusty Gibbon) - October 18 2007 - The switch to Ubuntu (GNOME)</p></li>
<li><p>Ubuntu 8.04 LTS (Hardy Heron) - April 24 2008</p></li>
<li><p>Ubuntu 8.10 (Intrepid Ibex) - October 30 2008</p></li>
<li><p>Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty Jackalope) - April 23 2009</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The next expected release, as you could have noticed on the sidebar, is <em>Ubuntu 9.10 (Karmic Koala) - October 29 2009</em>. Wish you a bunch of great new releases, Ubuntu!</p>

<p>For the curious ones, the Ubuntu musesum showcases some memories from all the releases that have been made <a href="http://people.canonical.com/~kirkland/Museum/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Happy Birthday!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.golem.de">Golem.de</a> has published a two part interview with Mark Shuttleworth (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Shuttleworth">Wikipedia entry</a>, his <a href="http://www.markshuttleworth.com">blog</a>), the founder of Canonical Ltd., the company that is behind <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a>. Some of the questions he tried to answer were:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Where do you see the Linux desktop today?</p></li>
<li><p>Does MacOS X offer a better user experience than Linux?</p></li>
<li><p>Does KDE do a better job than GNOME?</p></li>
<li><p>Besides look &amp; feel there are still problems with multimedia codecs. Isn&#8217;t that more important than the look &amp; feel of the desktop?</p></li>
<li><p>You already had a look at Windows 7&#8230; What is Microsoft doing better than Linux?</p></li>
<li><p>How important are netbooks for the success of Linux?</p></li>
<li><p>Reports seem to indicate that many users replace their Linux netbooks with Windows models.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The answers are sincere and very straight forward. Regarding the question about multimedia codecs, there is some ambiguity surrounding it. The problems with multimedia codecs in Linux are not related to the ability of Linux to play multimedia content or not, but whether the codecs for proprietary formats should be included by default in distributions or not. And the answer here is no, they shouldn&#8217;t be included by default in Ubuntu (or any other distribution) because of patents and copyright restrictions. Therefore the user should take the decision of installing or not the codecs for various proprietary formats. And that <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats">is really easy</a> in Ubuntu.</p>

<p>On the 22nd of October <a href="http://radu.cotescu.com/why-dont-you-switch-to-linux/">the poll</a> I launched on the 15th will close. After analysing the results I will post an article that should try to respond to all of the Windows users&#8217; misconceptions regarding Linux by showing them how easy and nice is to use free software.</p>

<p>Watch what Mark has to say. It might help you decide. :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you had time to read my blog before you would notice that I mostly write about technical stuff. Since Google indexes my pages, most of the users that arrive here are more or less above average when it comes to computers. Using the Analytics tool provided by Google, I get the following data when it comes to OS usage:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Windows - 56.53 %</p></li>
<li><p>Linux - 38.30 %</p></li>
<li><p>Macintosh - 4.67 %</p></li>
<li><p>Others - 0.5 % (iPod, iPhone, Android, BlackBerry, SymbianOS, NetBSD)</p></li>
</ol>


<p>My curiosity, given the fact that I write most about Linux (especially Ubuntu) here, is what, considering the percent of Windows users reaching here, keeps them from not making the switch. Therefore, I will resort using a poll for finding out the answer.</p>

<p>[poll id=&#8221;3&#8221; type=&#8221;result&#8221;]</p>

<p>If you have other reasons for which you haven&#8217;t switched please write them in the comments. I really want to know what&#8217;s keeping you using Windows and what could be done for Linux to gain more users. Thank you!</p>

      <p class="meta">
        








  


<time datetime="2009-10-11T14:12:04+03:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Oct 11<span>th</span>, 2009</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ubuntu 9.10, codenamed Karmic Koala, is just about the corner, with its programmed launch on October 29th. This release is a special one, preparing the way for the next LTS which is due to appear the next April (Lucid Lynx, 10.04). Lots and lots of features and improvements have been added, the main goal being to achieve a 10 second boot time for Lucid. In order to obtain that spectacular time, Karmic changed a few key components of the OS comparing it with the current release, 9.04 (codenamed Jaunty Jackalope).</p>

<h3><code>upstart</code></h3>

<p><code>upstart</code> is an event-based replacement for the usual <code>/sbin/init</code> daemon which handles starting of tasks and services during boot, stopping them during shutdown and supervising them while the system is running. Developed initially for the Ubuntu distribution, upstart is intended to be suitable for deployment in all Linux distributions as a replacement for System-V init. Among upstart&#8217;s users there are Fedora 9 and later, Debian (optional), Nokia&#8217;s Maemo platform and Palm&#8217;s WebOS.</p>

<h3><code>xsplash</code></h3>

<p>Having X starting sooner helped improve the boot times for Ubuntu. <code>xsplash</code> replaces <code>usplash</code> for displaying the boot screen, which allows using native resolutions, eliminating disproportioned boot screens. The only downside is that at shutdown, when the X is stopped, so is <code>xsplash</code>, removing all the eye-candy that masks the shutdown information. Therefore the user sees all the information regarding shutting down processes.</p>

<h3>Ubuntu Software Center</h3>

<p><em>Ubuntu Software Center</em> is a new application meant to replace <em>Synaptic Package Manager</em>, <em>Add/Remove&#8230;</em>, <em>Software Sources</em>, <em>Gdebi </em>and possible <em>Update Manager</em>. Again this is targeted at the 10.04 release, but the application has made it in Karmic. With a clean and interesting UI, the software center wants to be an easy and intuitive way to install applications and possible (in the future) to buy them. For every application there is the possibility of displaying a screen-shot that should preview the user where he/she should look for the launcher after the application is installed or how the application looks like.</p>

<h3>Ubuntu One</h3>

<p>Karmic Koala includes by default the client for accessing <a href="https://one.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu One</a> on-line file sharing and storing sevice which is based on Amazon S3 storage servers. The service is similar to <a href="http://getdropbox.com">Dropbox</a>, but unfortunately inferior in features and portability, as it runs only on Ubuntu clients (from 9.04 and forward). The service offers free 2GB accounts and 50GB payed ones ($10.00 USD).</p>

<h3>Other features</h3>

<p>Ubuntu 9.10 will include the new GNOME 2.28, <em>ext4</em> file system by default (the other file systems are still available using the manual partitioner, but will no longer be upgraded) and GRUB 2. Other security improvements have been added like <em>AppArmor</em> application profiles, better capabilities for UFW (<em>Uncomplicated Firewall</em>) and memory execution protection by handling code different.</p>

<h3>User experience</h3>

<p>I have tested Karmic Koala in a virtual machine using Sun&#8217;s VirtualBox allocating 512MB RAM and 2 processors, with a 3 partition style (swap, root folder and home folder - both <em>ext4</em>) for an 8GB virtual disk. The system boots incredibly fast (less than 20 seconds) and has a nice look. GNOME 2.28 has changed a bit from 2.26.1 which  is shipped in Ubuntu 9.04. I have also tested Empathy, the new multi-protocol instant messaging client, but I wasn&#8217;t thrilled. It still needs some features that Pidgin has been offering in the last two years. Still the desktop sharing functions and the audio/video capabilities (via selected protocols) are a strong addition. If you want to obtain the full performance potential <em>ext4</em> has to offer, you should opt for a clean install though. Just upgrading <em>ext3</em> to <em>ext4</em> won&#8217;t suffice, even if you will obtain some improvements. So be careful to use backups at least for your home folder.</p>

<p>Can&#8217;t wait for the official release! Will you upgrade too?</p>

<p>From the middle of July I have started a nice collaboration with OXY PRESS, the company responsible for the Linux Identity magazine series. They have asked me to write some articles for the Linux Starter Kit magazine, regarding Ubuntu 9.04 which I gladly did. I was happy to be able to share my experience with Ubuntu and do this for a magazine, not only for my blog. The result is finally ready and is available for buying from a various distribution market starting with October 9th.</p>

<p>Linux Starter Kit is aimed for those people new to Linux (n00bs as I like to call them, and this is not in a bad sense) and is trying to help them make their transition to this wonderful OS, usually from a proprietary world, as smooth as possible, showing them all the benefits one can gain by using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software">free</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">open-source</a> software. Treating aspects like installing Linux, configuring a dual boot, installing counterpart software for the one available for Windows and many more topics that are extremely important for the new user, this 5th issue about Ubuntu 9.04 is a really nice one, not only because I contributed to it but because Ubuntu has reached a level of user friendliness and popularity that boosts this distribution among the best out there.</p>
