  <div class="entry-content"><p>After enrolling to the University of Southampton Software Engineering MSc programme the iSolutions department (responsible with the IT infrastructure) provided me with an user account to be able to access all the facilities. The account also has an email address attached, which happens to be hosted by a Microsoft Exchange Server. And here the &#8220;conflict&#8221; begins. The University advises all its undergraduates or taught postgraduates to use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlook_Web_Access">OWA</a> web application or the University&#8217;s portal (which actually uses an iFrame to display the contents of OWA) to access their email accounts while the other students (research ones) and staff are allowed (and by this you must understand that iSolutions offers support for this) to use an email client.</p>

<p>I have never been a fan of using webmail. One of the reasons for this is the inability of such clients to provide all the features a desktop client. Since I use Ubuntu, I also couldn&#8217;t have accessed the full OWA application because I do not use IE (it&#8217;s against my beliefs to use such a lousy piece of software), leaving me with a limited webapp. Fortunately, I am a geek. My favourite email client is Thunderbird, which unfortunately cannot connect directly to Microsoft Exchange like Evolution (this is explicable through the partnership between Novell and Microsoft; in this particular case not even Evolution was able to connect to the server - the server version is unsupported). The only protocols available in Thunderbird are POP3 (old, blunt and poor as a solution regarding the number of mail capable devices I own), IMAP and SMTP. Even though I could have checked my University email using IMAP (they have enabled IMAP access on the Exchange Server), I couldn&#8217;t have accessed the Contacts or the Calendar features. The solution?! <em><strong>DavMail</strong></em>.</p>

<h2>DavMail</h2>

<p><a href="http://davmail.sourceforge.net/">DavMail</a> is a gateway between the OWA and whatever email client one uses. Written in Java, the application maps several ports on the localhost to the services offered by the Exchange Server. Since ports lower than 1024 need root access on UNIX and UNIX-like machines in order to be able to bind applications to them, DavMail usually uses the original protocol&#8217;s port numbers plus 1000 (e.g. 1110 for POP, 1143 for IMAP, 1025 for SMTP, 1080 for Caldav and 1389 for LDAP) but these settings are fully customizable.</p>

<p><a href="/uploads/wpuploads/2010/08/davmailArchitecture.png"><img src="/uploads/wpuploads/2010/08/davmailArchitecture-300x198.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Other nice features of DavMail include the ability to use the IDLE feature of the IMAP protocol to let the server push the messages to the client (this improves speed and network efficiency by reducing the number of queries made by the client to poll for new messages), the option to bind DavMail to an IP address for remote access for other &#8220;Exchange-impaired&#8221; clients, the auto-expunge IMAP feature (allowing for faster message deletions), logging and many more&#8230; The only Exchange feature that cannot be made available to Thunderbird 3 users is accessing the Contacts saved for one account (the personal address book created on the server). Still, this can be easily overcome by using the local address book from Thunderbird or using the information provided by a LDAP, since in most corporate environments all the needed contacts are stored this way.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s interesting about DavMail is that being only a layer, all the security is handled by the email client. Therefore you can&#8217;t compromise your accounts because of it. The setup is pretty straightforward and all of the Exchange features work as if using a dedicated client. I expected LDAP searching to be slow since we have a gateway between the client and the server, but it wasn&#8217;t the case. All the queries were fast and keep in mind that my University&#8217;s LDAP database is large (approximately 24000 students plus staff).</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>I wish Thunderbird could have offered Exchange support out of the box. Yes, it&#8217;s a Microsoft technology, but there seems that there are many adopters. Would I have liked it more if the University of Southampton used Google Apps? You bet! But since the only solution to access my account via a desktop client is using DavMail I actually have no complaints. I am happy that the program works okay, fast and that it is extremely easy to set up. Of course, if the server which holds your account doesn&#8217;t have the OWA service active you are toasted. Otherwise DavMail is just one cool little Java program.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday Oracle <a href="http://news.google.com/news/search?aq=0z&amp;pz=1&amp;cf=all&amp;ned=us&amp;hl=en&amp;q=oracle+sues+google&amp;oq=oracle+sues">announced</a> that it would sue Google over the use of Java on its Android platform. The net is screaming about this subject and most of the people commenting on it are defending Google. Although Google has its fair share of excellent contributions to the computing world, I do not think it&#8217;s fair to accuse Oracle without knowing the facts first. Most of the opinions against Oracle are based solely on the argument that Oracle bought Sun Microsystems and consequently MySQL and therefore Oracle is bad.</p>

<p>The Java Language Specification (which is protected by many patents some of which are in question in the aforementioned lawsuit), in its <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/third_edition/html/jcopyright.html">copyright notes</a>, mentions this (I have emphasized important phrases with italics):</p>

<blockquote><p>Sun Microsystems, Inc. (SUN) hereby grants to you a fully paid,  nonexclusive, nontransferable, perpetual, worldwide limited license  (without the right to sublicense) under SUN&#8217;s intellectual property  rights that are essential to practice this specification. This license  allows and is limited to the creation and distribution of clean room  implementations of this specification that: (i) include a complete  implementation of the current version of this specification <em>without  subsetting or supersetting</em>; (ii) implement all the interfaces and  functionality of the required packages of the Java 2 Platform, Standard  Edition, as defined by SUN, <em>without subsetting or supersetting</em>; (iii) do  not add any additional packages, classes, or interfaces to the java.<em>  or javax.</em> packages or their subpackages; (iv) pass all test suites  relating to the most recent published version of the specification of  the Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition, that are available from SUN six  (6) months prior to any beta release of the clean room implementation or  upgrade thereto; (v) <em>do not derive from SUN source code or binary  materials;</em> and (vi) <em>do not include any SUN source code or binary  materials without an appropriate and separate license from SUN</em>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Oracle&#8217;s complaint is available <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/35810897/Oracle-Google-Complaint">here</a>. By studying both the complaint and the above text one can clearly make the connections. It is also interesting to study the patents which have been used for the accusation counts.</p>

<p>I particularly dislike the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_%28person%29#Fanboy.2Ffangirl">fanboy-ism</a> that everyone is manifesting now and of course the double standards applied by the same happy bunch. When <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Java_Virtual_Machine#Sun_vs._Microsoft">Sun sued Microsoft</a> for breaching the license terms nobody jumped to defend Microsoft the same way they do with Google now. My suggestion is to wait for the court to pronounce its decision without starting flame-wars for free. After all, both Google and Oracle have begun showing their evil side in the last couple of years&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I&#8217;ve started working with <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, besides using the quick how-to guides from the official site, I&#8217;ve also wanted to read a more detailed book about how this distributed VCS tool should be used in order to benefit from all of its functionalities. One of these books is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430218339?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=prgi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1430218339">Pro Git</a> by Scott Chacon, from Apress. The e-book version I own dates from September 2009, although its content is freely available (with the proper updates and revisions) <a href="http://progit.org/">here</a>.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting tools for Git is Gitosis, an application which allows you to automate repository management and to have your own hosted repo on one of your servers (click <a href="apt:gitosis">here</a> to install it on Ubuntu; a good start-up guide can be found <a href="http://www.howtoforge.com/setting-up-gitosis-on-ubuntu">here</a>). In my case, this server is <a href="http://radu.cotescu.com/geeks-and-their-computers/">Geordi</a>. While I do use <a href="http://github.com/raducotescu">GitHub</a> too, Gitosis manages my non-public projects. Not only that Gitosis creates your repositories on the server once you need them, but it also handles user access allowing to have multiple users (commiters or followers) with read/write rights depending on the project.</p>

<p>Today I wanted to allow <a href="http://blog.motane.lu">Tudor</a> to be able to clone one of my private repositories but in the same time I didn&#8217;t want to give him push permissions. The edition of Pro Git I have listed this configuration for the previous job:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="o">[</span>group groupName<span class="o">]</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">writable</span> <span class="o">=</span> repoName
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">members</span> <span class="o">=</span> user1 user 2 user3
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">[</span>group groupName-readonly<span class="o">]</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">readable</span> <span class="o">=</span> repoName
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">members</span> <span class="o">=</span> user 4
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>With this set-up, every time when Tudor tried to clone my repository, Gitosis would respond with:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>ERROR:gitosis.serve.main:Repository <span class="nb">read </span>access denied
</span><span class='line'>fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The problem was on the highlighted line. It seems that the correct keyword for setting read-only user access is nothing other than <em><strong><code>readonly</code></strong></em>. With that put up in place everything worked as it should from the beginning. Although the online book now uses the correct keyword, you might still find PDF files of the book with the wrong example in which case you now have a solution.</p>

<p>Keep on pushing! ;)</p>

      <p class="meta">
        








  


<time datetime="2010-07-02T12:12:11+03:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jul 2<span>nd</span>, 2010</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since Ubuntu 9.04 appeared back in April, 2009, I&#8217;ve started building different <a href="http://radu.cotescu.com/category/vitualization/vmware/">scripts</a> that use community supplied patches in order to make the install process of VMware Server as easy as it was supposed to be. Still it seems that many of the users of my scripts misinterpret the help I offered by asking questions which have nothing to do specifically with the scripts but with how VMware Server works. To be clear in this aspect: I<em><strong> do not provide support</strong></em> for any of VMware&#8217;s products.</p>

<p>When I began offering these scripts I simply tried to ease the process of installing VMware Server on various kernels shipped with the distribution I use. Considering to be a cumbersome job to manually apply patches or to start an install process, stop it in the middle, apply a patch and then continue the install, I thought that I could help by eliminating all these steps. The scripts are released with no kind of guarantee towards the success of using the product. Furthermore, it should be noted that VMware Server is not officially supported on Ubuntu > 8.04, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server  > 10.1, Mandriva Corporate Server > 4, Red Hat Enterprise Linux > 5.1 and two other less popular distributions.</p>

<p>Using VMware Server on any other distribution than the ones indicated above and in the &#8220;VMware Server User&#8217;s Guide&#8221; available <a href="https://www.vmware.com/pdf/vmserver2.pdf">here</a> is solely your own responsibility. The only thing that I can guarantee to all of you using my scripts is the success of installing VMware Server on the unsupported kernels, a process which would fail without patching different files from the package. The fact that you might not be able to use all the server&#8217;s features is not my problem and unfortunately you don&#8217;t have an official way to obtain support.</p>

<p>A piece of advice that I might give to you is to not use VMware Server on unsupported kernels/distributions unless you are forced to. There are several other type 2 hypervisors which could do the job of providing virtual machines: QEMU, KVM, VirtualBox (which can be <a href="http://radu.cotescu.com/virtualbox-virtual-servers/">daemonized</a>), etc.</p>

<p>In conclusion, if you have VMware Server related problems please <em><strong>do not ask me for support</strong></em>. If you have problems in using one of the scripts I wrote I would be more than happy to assist but that&#8217;s the only thing I am able and willing to do for you.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>
