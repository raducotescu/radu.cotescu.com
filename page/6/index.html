  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="/uploads/wpuploads/2010/04/0202_MockupCover_Beginers-guide.jpg"><img src="/uploads/wpuploads/2010/04/0202_MockupCover_Beginers-guide-243x300.jpg" alt="OpenX Ad Server: Beginner's Guide" /></a>A few days ago I have finally finished reading the <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/openx-ad-server-beginners-guide/book"><em>OpenX Ad Server: Beginner’s Guide</em></a> book, by Murat Yilmaz, that PACKT publishing sent me for <a href="http://radu.cotescu.com/openx-ad-server-beginners-guide/">review</a>. The book deals with the aspect of installing and configuring the open-source OpenX Ad Server in order to serve advertisement campaigns on your websites. Being a <em>beginner&#8217;s guide</em>, the book doesn&#8217;t require advanced IT skills, stating that basic level would be enough to follow the subject. The reader should feel comfortable with using an FTP client, or cPanel&#8217;s file management features in case of using a managed web hosting service, and creating and administering a MySQL database.</p>

<p>Every chapter is divided into three distinct parts which might repeat: an introductory section with explanations, a &#8220;Time for action&#8221; section where guided by screenshots (a lot of them actually) the reader is shown how to perform various steps, a &#8220;What just happened?&#8221; section - which I personally find extremely annoying - that highlights the outcome, a &#8220;Pop quiz&#8221; section that should help the reader verify his/hers accumulated knowledge and the &#8220;Summary&#8221;.</p>

<p>The first chapter should get you going with OpenX by showing how to install the application under a web server and how to configure it. Unfortunately, this is the very moment when the author misadvises the reader to create a <em><strong>major security hole</strong></em> by setting the file permissions on some of the application&#8217;s folders to 777 (yes, OpenX Ad Server is officially supported on Linux only). What this means in non tech-savvy  language is that everybody has access to the respective folders: the owner (in this case the owner should be the user under which the web server runs), the group to which the owner belongs and everybody else. This would allow every script kiddie and medium talented hacker to make a breach into your system. Of course, OpenX has to be able to write into its own folders, but by no means those folders should have the 777 mask. In order to safely install OpenX I advise you to set the file permissions to 755 on folders (the owner has read/write/execute permissions while everybody else,  including his group, has only read and execute permissions) and 644 on files (read/write for the owner, read for everybody else). If you have access to your server&#8217;s shell this can be easily done by issuing these commands:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The only reason for which the folders need the execute bit is to be able to browse into them. Another factual error encountered in chapter one is that the author assumes the reader is using Windows Vista when all the operations needed to install and configure OpenX are platform independent.</p>

<p>Chapter two should give you the basic understanding of how OpenX works by doing some trivial operations like defining and adding an advertiser, a campaign, a banner and a website on which to display the campaign. All of these concepts are detailed in the next chapters by showing the reader the full capabilities of OpenX. With an abundance of screenshots, each action is guided every step so that you won&#8217;t get lost on the way. Being the first time when I work with OpenX I can&#8217;t seem to find anything that&#8217;s missing from this book, comparing the contents with the features of the ad server. Everything is explained in detail and in a simple language, in some sections very &#8220;simple&#8221; (see below). I like the fact that the author describes how to integrate OpenX Ad Server with popular platforms like Google AdSense, Blogger or Wordpress. Furthermore, the details offered for selectively serving your ads according to the websites&#8217; content are pretty well explained.</p>

<p>Chapters 7, 8 and 9 are about administering OpenX: user accounts, user roles and upgrades to the system. With almost 65 pages out of a total of 267 (a quarter of the book), these chapters could have included a security advisory section with topics like using OpenX on an SSL enabled web-server, web-server security and how to protect OpenX of unauthorized access.</p>

<p>The major drawback of this book is the language used. The author isn&#8217;t a native speaker, neither am I, but from pages 10 to 22 I have spotted 20 grammar mistakes, bad formed phrases or typos and this proportion seems to be constant throughout the book (you can convince yourself by reading the sample chapter available <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/sites/default/files/sample_chapters/0202_OpenX%20Ad%20Server%20Beginner%27s%20Guide_SampleChapter.pdf">here</a>). This comes as a surprise because the book has officially been reviewed by two other people, namely Jose Argudo and Mert Erkal, and of course the editors. Even if the content is interesting and helpful, this aspect of poor language (which is not at all excusable) corroborated with <em>bad security practices</em> and the fact that some of the guides aren&#8217;t described as being platform independent lowers the value considerably, down to the point where the money asked for the printed book or for the e-book version is not at all justified.</p>

<p>If PACKT would republish the book by correcting all the inadvertences described above, I would recommend it for all of you who are beginners in administering your own online advertisement network. Otherwise <em>it simply doesn&#8217;t worth buying it</em> because OpenX has proper <a href="http://www.openx.org/en/support/documentation">documentation</a> that should help you get started, which is freely accessible, and the user interface is pretty straight-forward.</p>

<time datetime="2010-05-31T12:11:29+03:00" pubdate data-updated="true">May 31<span>st</span>, 2010</time>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was introduced to Oracle&#8217;s TopLink <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping">ORM</a> package during my second internship at Oracle. Although the API (because TopLink actually became the reference implementation for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Persistence_API">JPA</a> 2.0) seemed a bit overwhelming at first, I&#8217;ve managed to get a grasp of it quite fast, allowing me to finish the assigned projects in time. The familiarity with the API and with Toplink Workbench, a graphical tool designed to help you map database tables into Java classes (basically JavaBeans), made me use this combination for my diploma project (which I&#8217;ve been talking about more or less on my previous posts).</p>

<p>Working on a parser that would extract objects out of some very large text files (about 1.8 million lines) and would then persist them into a DB, I was required to eliminate duplicates. I had two options:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>parse the file, create an object, verify if the object was persisted by doing a SELECT query in the DB after its attributes (actually TopLink handled this part) and if the result was null persist the new object;</p></li>
<li><p>parse the file, create objects, persist them, eliminate duplicates after all objects have been parsed using a <em>stored procedure.</em></p></li>
</ol>


<p>While method 1 uses only the sequence values needed for the operation (I&#8217;m using sequences for my primary keys), for each INSERT a SELECT has to be made before, which would induce a performance fault. Method 2 on the other hand uses more sequence values than the first one by inserting more rows than actually needed, but even with this issue in mind it turned out to work faster. So there you go, we have a winner.</p>

<p>Using <em>stored procedures</em> has some advantages and as well some disadvantages. The advantages are that nothing is quicker than native database code and this option allows you to write complex operations using a simple implementation language (SQL, PL/SQL) which would be quite hard to write using programming languages. The disadvantages come in the application layer, because these stored procedures aren&#8217;t portable: if you change your database engine, let&#8217;s say from MySQL to Oracle, chances are that 99.5% you must rewrite those procedures.</p>

<p>In my case the stored procedure doesn&#8217;t return any rows, it actually deletes duplicates:</p>

<p>where ToplinkSession is a singleton class with a static method for returning a <code>Session</code> (or <code>DatabaseSession</code>) object. Note the highlighted line: if you would use a <code>ReadAllQuery</code> instead of <code>DataModifyQuery</code> you&#8217;d get a <code>java.sql.SQLException</code> nested in an <code>oracle.toplink.DatabaseException</code> together with an <strong>ORA-00900</strong> error message, even if the generated SQL doesn&#8217;t contain errors. This is because the <code>ReadAllQuery</code> expects data to return, while the other doesn&#8217;t. So the correct way of calling stored procedures that don&#8217;t return data is with the help of <code>DataModifyQuery</code>.</p>

<p>I hope that by having all this cleared out you won&#8217;t deal with this error any more.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://virtualbox.org"><img src="/uploads/wpuploads/2010/05/vbox-300x225.png" alt="Oracle VirtualBox" /></a>A considerable amount of my diploma project runs on several virtual machines, due to the lack of multiple physical machines required for the job. Of course, <a href="http://radu.cotescu.com/geeks-and-their-computers/">Riker</a> isn&#8217;t tailored for production regarding this project, but it was built specifically to allow me to develop the code without restrictions. For a load under 10 users I think it would do the job quite okay. You might be asking yourself what kind of project it is if an Intel Core i7 930 processor couldn&#8217;t handle the job. I&#8217;m not going to tell you&#8230; Yet.</p>

<p>Because of the way <a href="http://radu.cotescu.com/category/vitualization/vmware/">VMware Server</a> works on the last kernels from Ubuntu this tool couldn&#8217;t have offered me the stability and performance I need. And because I really like to use my graphics card to decode HD content, Xen or VMware ESXi weren&#8217;t an option either. What was left? VirtualBox is made for desktop virtualization. Still, the ease of use of this product and the fact that it never ever failed for my needs made me actually consider it could be up for the job. Of course, the only problem I had was daemonizing it somehow so that I could run the virtual machines without necessarily being logged in. It actually crossed my mind a few times to write some scripts which would rely on the CLI tools that VirtualBox provides, but the lack of time always made me think twice before this.</p>

<p>At some point in time though, I discovered <a href="http://vboxtool.sourceforge.net/">VBoxTool</a>, which coincidentally is nothing more than a collection of wrapper scripts written in BASH which help you daemonize the hypervisor. How cool is that? Provided that you set up a configuration file and add an init script to the desired runlevels (all this by following proper written explanations directly from the author), this &#8220;facade framework&#8221; (design pattern pun intended) will automatically start/resume the desired virtual machines and will shutdown/suspend them together with your host. I had to modify about four lines of code to alter a bit the behaviour for shutdown so that my VMs would always get suspended instead of turned off, but that&#8217;s almost nothing.</p>

<p>The VMs that are on most of the time both run Ubuntu Server 10.04 64bit: one with 2 GB of RAM and Oracle 11G, the other with 128 MB hosting an internal repository under <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nginx">nginx</a> (which is a <em>very</em> fast web server). They both work great and my host doesn&#8217;t at all feel sluggish. Actually all these three machines (host + 2 guests) run incredibly well. The maximum sustained throughput I achieved using the virtualized repository was 60 MB/s which is pretty impressive. I haven&#8217;t tried yet to test the DB engine with a consistent load (a great number of queries directed to it simultaneously) but I will get that chance near the end of June when I&#8217;ll perform some load testing on my application.</p>

<p>By the way, nine days ago VirtualBox 3.2 has been released (the first release of VB since Oracle acquired Sun) and a bunch of <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Changelog">new features</a> have seen daylight. Check it out.</p>

<p>Considering that there&#8217;s a reliable way of running virtualized servers into a daemonized VirtualBox, do you still want to puzzle yourself with VMware Server&#8217;s erratic behaviour?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Having to write an article dealing with a part of my diploma project for the <em>Students&#8217; Papers Session</em> in my University, I discovered that some fonts (particularly &#8220;ș&#8221; and &#8220;ț&#8221;) were displayed awkward in Writer, the word processing software from OpenOffice.org. By awkward I mean that &#8220;ș&#8221; and &#8220;ț&#8221; were using other fonts than &#8220;s&#8221; and  &#8220;t&#8221;. The strange thing is that this was happening only on my laptop, while on my desktop everything worked okay. Both these machines have the same software stack (Ubuntu 10.04 x86_64 and OpenOffice.org 3.2).</p>

<p>Browsing the web for a solution I couldn&#8217;t find anything pointing in the right direction. Still, what I&#8217;ve managed to observe was that on my laptop I had a <code>.fonts</code> folder in my home directory which seemed to contain the exact font I was using in Writer (and that was stored in the system fonts folder too). When I looked on my desktop for that specific folder, surprise: there wasn&#8217;t any. While this folder keeps user specific fonts, the main folder where the fonts are kept for the entire system is <code>/usr/share/fonts</code>. I&#8217;ve then decided to delete the <code>.fonts</code> folder from my home directory (I still don&#8217;t know what created it) and then I&#8217;ve regenerated the font cache, using this command:</p>

<p>&#8220;` bash</p>

<p>Now everything is back to normal in my font world. Maybe I&#8217;ll use LaTeX when it&#8217;s time to write the real deal.</p>
